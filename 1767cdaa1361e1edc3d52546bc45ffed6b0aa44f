      "message": "This simplifies deleting the semaphore, but other than that it doesn\u0027t do much. There\u0027s a part 2 to this where I revert hrev58264 and allow Tracker to display the same right-click menu twice consecutively but unfortunately that doesn\u0027t quite work yet. However this does prevent Tracker from crashing in a couple cases that it would have before hrev58264 worked around the underlying issue. So Traker wouldn\u0027t crash with this, but it still has some odd behavior with consecutive right-clicks, especially quickly.",
