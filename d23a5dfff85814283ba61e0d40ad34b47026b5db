We’re also using B_PARTIALLY_ACTIVATED to mean that a scroll bar is scrollable. I don’t want to draw the scroll bar buttons B_PARTIALLY_ACTIVATED when the scroll bar is scrollable so I set the flag after drawing the buttons but perhaps this could be reworked.",

      "message": "This needed a bit more work. We always want to draw non-scrollable scroll bars as if they were disabled so instead of looking at the B_PARTIALLY_ACTIVATED flag in HaikuControlLook and BeControlLook, set the B_DISABLED flag in BScrollBar when not scrollable and only consider the B_DISABLED flag in HaikuControlLook and BeControlLook. There was an edge case where drawing the scroll bar arrow using DrawArrowShape on a non-scrollable scroll bar would draw the arrow as though it was enabled in BControlLook when it should have been draw as disabled. I couldn\u0027t consider the B_PARTIALLY_ACTIVATED flag here because DrawArrowShape is also used to draw arrows in menus and in outline list views which don\u0027t understand B_PARTIALLY_ACTIVATED.",
