      "message": "There are two problems with changing this structure:\n- The size of the structure changes, so old settings files will not load anymore\n- You added a field in the middle of the structure, so tapgesture_sensibility will not be loaded properly even if we take care about the structure size\n\nSince we want to cleanly migrate the settings, support for loading settings using the old format should be restored. And while we are at it, we could change the settings file format to be an archived BMessage instead of directly storing the structure data, so in the future we don\u0027t hit such migration problems again. BMessage makes it safer to add and reorder fields.",
