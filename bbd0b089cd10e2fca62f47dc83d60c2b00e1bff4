They put everything in a namespace containing the version number. This allows multiple versions of ICU to be used in the same app (because it depends on various libraries that each depend on ICU, for example).\n\nSo, yes, we want Haiku to depends strictly on one specific ABI version, depending on the package it was built against.",
