      "message": "I have trouble testing. I\u0027ve build the chanage, put \"Tracker\" into ~/config/non-packaged/ and libtracker.so into ~/config/non-packaged/lib/. Reboot and disabled Tracker and libtracker.so from the boot options.\nlistimage shows both non-packaged lib and Tracker, so that seems to be OK...\n\nI don\u0027t see any change... Move/Cut/Move-to-Trash etc. are all enabled when looking at /system/apps. Same with a read-only Linux partition.\n\nOn beta4 Tracker, the background of the label of a selected item on Deskbar always stays black. With this change they turn grey when the Desktop loses focus. This is now consistent with how it\u0027s done with all other Tracker windows. However, while it looks ok grey with a white backdrop, it doesn\u0027t look that nice on the darker background image of the Desktop.\n\nWRT copying a name via \"Edit name\", maybe the the label text and background colour could signal that it\u0027s a read-only file, so copying is OK but changes won\u0027t stick. Like using a grey text and possibly a lighter grey background.",
