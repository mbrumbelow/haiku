      "message": "Ok, so there seems to be no option in Gerrit\u0027s web UI to display the Change-Id (there\u0027s only one for the change number) so since this is such a simple patch and I lost a lot of time trying to figure this out I\u0027ve just abandoned the previous two and made this the definitive. The git hook is properly configured now so I shouldn\u0027t have this problem anymore. Thanks for the patience and the reviews and sorry about the inconveniences.",

I\u0027ll need to reinstate the old one, play with git and push again, only to abandon this one after. I\u0027d rather just leave this one if that\u0027s ok with you.",
