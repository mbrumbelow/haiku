      "message": "Thanks for reviewing, waddlesplah!\n\nI originally used (uintptr_t) for TCSBRK, instead of (int)(unitptr_t) as in TCFLSH because I thought... well, it is only used to create the \"set\" boolean right below.\n\nUnlike the int from TCFLSH, that korli made me realize it is sent as proper int down the line (pc_serial expects an int for TTYFLUSH).\n\nJust asking to better understand (I\u0027m not really good at this :-D): your change is for better style/consistency? Or the original was improper?",
