      "message": "with this change (and the related one) I can set an MTU \u003c 1500 and witnessed it happen via tcpdump.\nset 525, see packets up to 484 in tcpdump.   Setting above 1500 failed... but that could be a limitation of rtl8xxx fbsd driver\n\nThis might need adjusted to function differently.\n\nwith the code as it was... the SIOCSIFMTU calls were going directly to wlan_control for BSD drivers instead of applying from the generic stack code.",

It may not be obvious that ioctl\u0027s in wlan come though the freebsd stack.\n\nun-commented code (especially in critical areas where lots of stuff is happening at once) is a risk.\n\nwith that said, i don\u0027t care enough to fight on it more. I\u0027ve moved on for now.",
