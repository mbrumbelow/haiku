      "message": "I still don\u0027t agree with the use of BHttpSession for storing these things.\n\nIt should be named BHttpContext as in the previous iterations of the API.\n\nThe idea of a \"session\", for example for cookies, is very specific, and session cookies are non-persistent and never saved to disk. So, using BHttpSession as a name here is confusing.",

      "message": "I think that exceptions should all inherit from a base class (std::exception or a custom one, maybe one specific to each kit).\n\nThe reason for this is the ability to do a general \"catch all exceptions\" case in an useful way.\n\nTypically code would look like this\n\ntry {\n    // do something\n} catch (const unsupported_protocol_exception\u0026 e) {\n    BAlert(B_TRANSLATE(\"Unsupported protocol\"));\n} catch (const Exception\u0026 e) {\n    BAlert(B_TRANSLATE(\"Something unexpected happened: %s\", e.what));\n}\n\nWithout a common base class, the second catch clause has no info at all to give, which will lead to a very uninformative error message, even worse than the strerror based ones we have now.",
