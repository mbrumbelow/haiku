      "message": "I know that this is not a nice and clean patch but somehow we need to tackle the following situation:\n* there\u0027s different kernel load base for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures\n* the current EFI implementation uses whichever is defined in the arch headers\n* but on the x86 both of them are defined\n* we need to use KERNEL_LOAD_BASE on x86 32-bit, KERNEL_LOAD_BASE_64_BIT on x86_64. So we can\u0027t say either one takes precedence.\n\nWhat could be a better way of achieving this, without introducing arch-dependent ifdefs in the code?",
