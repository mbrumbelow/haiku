      "message": "I just did a quick check to see if there\u0027s any regression on real hardware (i.e. rpi3/rpi4) and it seems that now we can\u0027t reuse the 8250 driver for the mini-UART any more, at least not as-is. The InitPort function seems to mess up the mini-UART settings and from that point we get only gibberish. So here we introduce a mini-driver for the mini-UART that skips the initialization - which is not needed as it\u0027s already initialized by the firmware anyway.",
