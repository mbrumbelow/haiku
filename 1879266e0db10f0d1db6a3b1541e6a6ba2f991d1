I don\u0027t know why there is a separate license block here (especially as the license terms look quite similar).\n\nAlso, either you keep your copyright to yourself, or you assign it to Haiku. Here you both added yourself, and updated Haiku\u0027s copyright year, why is that so?",

I asked about this in the channel as I\u0027m not aware of the original author\u0027s contact details in order to see if I could get it removed. I\u0027ll add myself there. I\u0027m giving the right to every person that currently has permission to push commits to the official Haiku tree (the one hosted under \"haiku-os.org\") and board members of Haiku, Inc. to remove the notice and replace it with an equivalent \"Distributed under the terms of the MIT License.\", as long as the copy of the MIT license itself does not differ from the content of the notice in the source file (asterisks and extra spaces excluded). I want to keep the copyright assigned to me.",
