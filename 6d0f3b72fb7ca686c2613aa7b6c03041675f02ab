      "message": "This would still return 0 in the common case of nothing being specified for default Cmd based shortcuts.\n\nLike I said before, `PrepareModifiers` previously had two purposes:\n\n1. Initialize modifiers when setting up the shortcuts, as called by the developer when building their GUI.\n2. Cleaning up modifiers in _FindShortcut before checking shortcuts.\n\nWhen Cmd was always required this one function could serve both purposes, but now I don\u0027t think it makes as much sense to use it for both. To keep things sane I think B_NO_COMMAND_KEY needs to just be something handled on the initialization side and not in keyboard handling, hence adding `_InitializeModifiers`. Also then in my old change I made `PrepareModifiers` just `return modifiers \u0026 AllowedModifiers();` (so it doesn\u0027t always tack on `B_COMMAND_KEY`.)\n\nI recall testing my change with ShowImage and I am pretty sure it worked, though it has been a long time.",
