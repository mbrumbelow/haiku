Your comments have also lead me to realise that the `ProcessCoordinator` need not be `BReferencable` and so I\u0027ve made some more changes on `MainWindow` to stop using `BReference\u003c\u003e` for the process coordinator there as well.  This is because the \u0027referencable\u0027 setup contained loops that was resulting in objects not being deleted.",
