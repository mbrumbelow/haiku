      "message": "I think you cannot use B_TRANSLATE in the global context this way? You would need to use B_TRANSLATE_MARK here, and then B_TRANSLATE_NOCOLLECT in the code where the string is actually used. This is because B_TRANSLATE works only after initialization of BApplication is complete.\n\nAlso, this is missing a ; at the end of the line. Please test your changes before submitting them. Submitting non-compiling code makes a bad impression, it looks like you did not test your changes.",
