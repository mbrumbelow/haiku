That may explain why you had trouble updating the change previously.\n\nYou can add the change-id manually for next revisions of a patch (it is available in the web ui of Gerrit), but it may be simpler to set up the Gerrit commit hook to generate it automatically whenever you create a commit. The installation instructions are at https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/building/get-source-git\n\nIt will avoid having to track comments accross different change requests.",
