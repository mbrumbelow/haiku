      "message": "It seems like removing __BEGIN_DECLS macro gives build error for arch gcc2h as build logs of bot suggests there is undefined reference for calculate_crc32c, But we do need to remove it for successful build on arch x86_64.\n\nIf we could add aarch macros here we will be fine with build for both gcc2h and x86_64 arch.\nWhat do you think about this @PulkoMandy?",

      "message": "Is there some reason why superblock is constructed through class instead of struct?\nOther filesystems simply use struct here.\n\nActually when we will use offsetof(XfsSuperBlock,sb_crc) we will get compiler warning for using non - POD structure.\nThough compiler builds it fine and we get all correct values for offset but still it will be an issue if gcc upgrades this warning to error in future.\n\nSimple solution to fix this warning is instead of class use struct and remove all access specifier.",
