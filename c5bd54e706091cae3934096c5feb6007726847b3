Please have in mind that there will be BAffineTransform variant. Not that it prevents phase from having default value.\n\nI don\u0027t have preference, so let me know which one you think is better.",

      "message": "My guess is DrawBitmap is this way to preserve ABI compatibility as parameters were added to the existing function. Or maybe default arguments weren\u0027t possible in all cases (it is not possible to default bitmapRect to aBitmap-\u003eBounds(), for example, as it refers to another parameter of the method).\n\nUsing a default parameter makes one less method to document, and makes it clear what the default value is, before reading its implementation I was wondering if it would be B_ORIGIN, the rectangle top-left corner, or the current pen location. If we just have this in the method prototype, the question is answered immediately.\n\nIt is also faster (the methods are public so not inline-able) and smaller (less code generated).",
