      "message": "This no longer serves its former primary purpose of supporting function key shortcuts since I got that feature to work without extending the BMenuItem and BWindow classes. This PS could still be useful to support multibyte shortcut keys  if we wish to have them. I updated the patch so that it would not be stale but this is not currently fully hooked up and would need a test case and a bit more work for inclusion. The patch works in the sense that it doesn\u0027t break anything.",
