      "message": "I asked on the devel mailing list whether Deskbar should use plain font or menu font and the answer I received was plain font. It doesn’t matter to me which font we go with as long as it’s consistent. FWIW BeOS R5 uses plain font on Deskbar. This code allows us to use the menu font in Tracker for these classes while using the plain font on Deskbar.",

      "message": "I\u0027m quite borderline on this issue as well. I have my menu font set to a monospace font to test this change. I personally like how it makes the menubar and their menus look in applications. The look there is consistent. However, it doesn\u0027t look so good for the Deskbar. Deskbar using the plain font and the menu using the menu font is a bit jarring of a contrast. Unfortunately, this change means that not all menus will use the menu font. Like I said, I\u0027m quite borderline on this issue, but I\u0027m leaning towards the way this change set does things.",
