      "message": "Installer checks whether we used FirstBootPrompt to initiate Installer by checking whether the Deskbar is running in the background. I ultimately used that method, as that is what was used in Installer before.\n\nHowever, another component does this in a different way -- it checks the following:\n- does the FirstBootPrompt binary exist? (I assume this is useful in the context of bootstrapping)\n- does /boot/home/config/settings/Locale\\ settings exist?\n\nLink: https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/commit/data/launch/user?id\u003d1ec3f11d9743f547fd65658d6b56f74cae82e692\n\nI would definitely appreciate some direction in that regard.",

      "message": "That seems correct for Installer. The launch script logic is different because it detects if FirstBootPrompt should be run. The conditions for that are:\n- FirstBootPrompt executable exists (obviously?)\n- No language is selected yet, so we should ask the user to pick one\n\nAfter FirstBootPrompt has run, the locale settings file will be created so this method can\u0027t be used anymore.\n\nAcleaner approach would be for FirstBootPrompt to pass a command line argument to Installer or send it a message when it starts it. Just in case someone has replaced the DeskBar with something else on theis install",

There\u0027s seriously a lot of technical debt over here. Is, for the purpose of this patch, retaining what was previously there and adding a TODO comment somewhere acceptable?",

      "message": "Please be explicit as to whether you believe that this information should be put exclusively in the information document and that this change should not be included into the system.\n\nIf that\u0027s not the case, I believe this concern is out-of-scope for the time being and I\u0027d gladly follow up with another change that includes this information in the EULA at a later stage.\n\nIf that is the case, I strongly believe that popups are not good enough and \"bad UX\" (a previous change of mine lets people know that they should create a partition using the Be File System, despite a pop-up telling them to do so) and that a long EULA document that even fewer people are going to read would not make the cut either.\n\nMy change does not account for every edge case (you could use a Haiku USB to copy the contents of an already existing Haiku installation in a second partition onto an empty partition, which is actually not far from unrealistic but presumably something an \"advanced\" user would do -- this could be added at a later stage, but educating the user is the priority and the problem I\u0027m trying to tackle here), but will inform the user about this for what I believe to be the most common occurrence of people copying a system with their files -- while not being shown when it\u0027s likely that the user doesn\u0027t have any of their data in the system itself.\n\nThumb drives can also have data stored in them and act as an ordinary Haiku installation when you reboot for the second time, so I believe that this case scenario is actually also valid *enough*, as we can only currently approximate who\u0027s the best target to show it to. While implementing this change, I tried to answer the question of \"who *doesn\u0027t* need to hear this so that we don\u0027t overwhelm them about some \u0027risk\u0027 that does not exist\", instead of finding out about every single person that does.

      "message": "\u003e the proper solution of adding a \"whole disk\" mode should be preffered\n\nWhat are you talking about? This is completely independant of the \"whole disk\" mode. This is just a message saying that the whole source partition will be copied, including any extra packages, custom background with pictures of your family/dog/{girl,boy}friend/whatever, ssh keys, saved wifi networks, passwords, and so on. This is certainly unexpected from a tool named \"Installer\", and deserves a warning.\n\nAs for the \"EULA\" (which isn\u0027t one), no one reads it. Indeed, lawyers have successfully trained people to ignore these things. Likewise for popups, Windows users are trained to ignore those because Windows apps tend to use them way too much.\n\nSo, I think our best option here is indeed modifying this text.
