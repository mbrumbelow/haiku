      "message": "Installer checks whether we used FirstBootPrompt to initiate Installer by checking whether the Deskbar is running in the background. I ultimately used that method, as that is what was used in Installer before.\n\nHowever, another component does this in a different way -- it checks the following:\n- does the FirstBootPrompt binary exist? (I assume this is useful in the context of bootstrapping)\n- does /boot/home/config/settings/Locale\\ settings exist?\n\nLink: https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/commit/data/launch/user?id\u003d1ec3f11d9743f547fd65658d6b56f74cae82e692\n\nI would definitely appreciate some direction in that regard.",

      "message": "That seems correct for Installer. The launch script logic is different because it detects if FirstBootPrompt should be run. The conditions for that are:\n- FirstBootPrompt executable exists (obviously?)\n- No language is selected yet, so we should ask the user to pick one\n\nAfter FirstBootPrompt has run, the locale settings file will be created so this method can\u0027t be used anymore.\n\nAcleaner approach would be for FirstBootPrompt to pass a command line argument to Installer or send it a message when it starts it. Just in case someone has replaced the DeskBar with something else on theis install",

      "message": "Thanks for the perspective as to how this could be done in a cleaner manner. We should get to that at one point or another if we want to make the Installer more sophisticated. There\u0027s seriously a lot of technical debt over here. Is, for the purpose of this patch, retaining what was previously there and adding a TODO comment somewhere acceptable?",
