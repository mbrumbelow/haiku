      "message": "Installer checks whether we used FirstBootPrompt to initiate Installer by checking whether the Deskbar is running in the background. I ultimately used that method, as that is what was used in Installer before.\n\nHowever, another component does this in a different way -- it checks the following:\n- does the FirstBootPrompt binary exist? (I assume this is useful in the context of bootstrapping)\n- does /boot/home/config/settings/Locale\\ settings exist?\n\nLink: https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/commit/data/launch/user?id\u003d1ec3f11d9743f547fd65658d6b56f74cae82e692\n\nI would definitely appreciate some direction in that regard.",
