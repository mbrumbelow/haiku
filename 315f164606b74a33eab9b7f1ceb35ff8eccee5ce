      "message": "Just FYI, I installed Haiku on a machine with a somewhat complicated USB setup (KVM, Hub, ...) and had frequent kernel panics, which suggested the fixed first location (where fNode\u003d\u003dNULL).\nOn a Linux installation on the same machine I also saw some USB related error messages, so it seems plausible, that there are some USB related issues.\n\nFor the other checks I noticed that there were missing NULL pointer checks as well, but I could not figure out yet, whether the pointers can actually be NULL or whether one can rely on them to be always valid. In the latter case I could remove these again if desired.",
