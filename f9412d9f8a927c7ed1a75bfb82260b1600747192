Not sure if the UEFI spec also had some recommendations. I think there was something important in the 8.2 arch. Older archs is probably better served by 32 bit arch anyway.",

      "message": "It is easier to discuss on IRC.\nI guess I uploaded a full bootstrap of all packages needed including zstd. Bootstrapping and porting all packages needs to be redone if you want these packages to not use fp16. It\u0027s a a lot of work to bootstrap and one of the reasons I lost all energy, I did start with lower specs but this was the lowest that I could get working and I\u0027m unlikely to touch bootstrapping again..\n\nI\u0027d recommend getting a arm8.2 version fully booting first, as it is a much lower hanging fruit.\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, you can go which way you want, I am just explaining why we ended up with those specs in the first place.",

Armv8.2 means compiler generates incorrect  opcodes for Armv8(A53/A57/A72/...). Therefore the arm64 port cannot progress, if the targets that are used for development(looks QEMU too) just became unsupported as they don\u0027t support armv8.2 instructions.",
