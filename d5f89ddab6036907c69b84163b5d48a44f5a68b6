      "message": "It seems gcc2 does not handle a lone \".\" for the precision. But anyways, according to the Linux manpage, that would be ecuivalent to .0, and not change the behavior at all.\n\nDo you need help building and testing your changes? If so, it would be helpful to ask for help, instead of letting us discover that you did not fully test this, and that you broke the build, but also not fix the problem you say you did.",
