      "message": "And here, you should probably round up and convert to bigtime_t as well: return (bigtime_t)ceil(frameCount * 1000000 / frameRate). Note that using frameCount first will make the multiplication 64-bit automatically, since frameCount is 64-bit. (It\u0027s probably the same if frameCount comes second, i\u0027d have to google that...) and then dividing by frameRate make the operation float. Hm. Maybe that would actually be a good reason to declare frameRate \"double\" at the beginning of the function. You could run some tests with big numbers if it makes a difference in precision.",

Adding silence at the end of the sound to match the duration is always possible, removing anything is never safe.\n\nIt does not matter much anyways, we hava a microsecond resolution here and the framerate will be at best a tenth of that? (ok, I have one app that generates 125kHz output, but that\u0027s already very uncommon)",
