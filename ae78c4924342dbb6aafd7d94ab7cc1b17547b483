In current use cases flattened BPicture\u0027s are short-lived, it are used when printing for example. So I think it should be fine to fix it.\n\nHaiku do not increment BPicture version, so there are no way to distinguish it.",

If we find that something is broken, we can always revert the change or add support for Haiku format.
