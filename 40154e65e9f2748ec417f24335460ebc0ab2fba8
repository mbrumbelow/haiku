      "message": "Yes, good idea, and this is also the recommended format when option -P is used in the POSIX spec: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/df.html (which we don\u0027t follow at all, it isn\u0027t a great spec in this specific case).\n\nI think a \"better\" fix here would be to move /boot/system/var/shared_memory to a better mountpoint (/RAM or something like that), and have /boot/system/var symlink to it (or to a directory inside it) if really needed. Since it is \"just\" a RAMFS, and it is very convenient to have a RAMFS for many reasons besides implementing shared memory, it would be great to expose it more, I think?",
