      "message": "There\u0027s a little snag, I\u0027d need advice on:\n\nBy using FSCreateNewFolder() the function FSMakeOriginalName() is triggered, which will rename the newly created folder to, e.g. \"New submenu- 2\" (there\u0027s something wrong with the naming here, too, but no matter now) if there\u0027s already a \"New submenu\" folder present.\nThe subsequent adding of the kAttrTemplateSubMenu attribute, will be done on the non-renamed old \"New submenu\" folder. Same for the opening+selecting.\n\nAny ideas to solve this, short of duplicating what FSCreateNewFolder() and FSMakeOriginalName() are doing?",
