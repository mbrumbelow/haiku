      "message": "This is based on my not getting what I expected with a non-word-wrapping text view in a scroll view in a vertical group layout, not on any knowledge or understanding of BTextView. I don\u0027t even know what the change might break.\n\nWhat I observed was that initially the text rect is invalid, and while being so there\u0027s no search for line breaks, and so there\u0027s just one line with its width (and other properties) set to 0, which means a preferred width of 0 that gets changed to the minimum one that depends on font metrics and not on the text.",

      "message": "Dunno. Maybe, if line breaks were already calculated on text insertion when !fWrap, but that\u0027s not the case. You may `Insert(\"This is a line\\n\")` as much as you want, and all the text will internally be one line until it goes through this method. That is, with `if (!fWrap || ...)` there would be no line breaks without word-wrapping.",
