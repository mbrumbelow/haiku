I don\u0027t even know what the change might break.\n\nWhat I observed was that initially the text rect is invalid, and while being so there\u0027s no search for line breaks, and so there\u0027s just one line with its width (and other properties) set to 0, which means a preferred width of 0 that gets changed to the minimum one that depends on font metrics and not on the text.",
