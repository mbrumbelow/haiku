      "message": "Small nitpick... I know you copied this from my change in Tracker... but could you replace 0x20 with B_SPACE? They are one in the same but B_SPACE is more clear I think for those not familiar with the ASCII numbering... It seems like you\u0027ve cut too deeply anyway here, you\u0027ll need to also re-allow B_TAB and B_ENTER. Tracker doesn\u0027t need those for file names but StyledEdit does for indents and newlines.",
