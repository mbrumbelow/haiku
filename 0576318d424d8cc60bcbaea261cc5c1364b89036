      "message": "In my version of this I had to change this logic in several places, and in fact I pulled out a helper _IsValidShortcut to avoid duplication everywhere. I think this change needs that as well to actually have these shortcuts installed in the window.\n\nOverall though I think I prefer the B_NO_COMMAND_KEY name to my B_NO_MODIFIERS, plus I think you can probably get this merged while I have not had time to work on mine. But maybe you can look over mine to see if you need to add anything here:\n\nhttps://review.haiku-os.org/c/haiku/+/2603\n\nSome of my changes might be unneeded though.",
