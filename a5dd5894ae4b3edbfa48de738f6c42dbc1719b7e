      "message": "This changed has been tested on different locales, font sizes, and workspace background colors.\n\nWidth is fixed at launch but is calculated to be large enough to fit based on font-size and locale. Most fit in the default width but Greek has a particularly wide memory size so this is accounted for by making system information width wider.\n\nHeight may change in Pulse() if uptime wraps or unwraps. If the view is a replicant the bottom stays in the same position and the view grows up so that the dragger will not be moved off-screen. Uptime is allowed to grow forever making the view taller as it wraps. However uptime should fit on one line most of the time.\n\nFont size of replicant and Tracker DeskWindow may differ, the replicant font size is used.\n\nReplicant color is either black or white depending on background color. A separate patch was made to\nupdate the color on workspace change when switching from a dark background to a light one because it depends on an IK change.",
