      "message": "revised version:\n* define struct crypt_data similarly to musl and FreeBSD: add initialized field for better compatibility with applications written for glibc. Apart from that, we don\u0027t store any internal state here, only the output buffer. I reserved 512 bytes for the output buffer, I guess that would be good enough for some time?\n* crypt_rn() could be a better ABI - similarly to libxcrypt.\n* I kept the crypt_r() implementation as well, not sure if we can do much better here.\n\nAny suggestions?\n",
