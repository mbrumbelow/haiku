      "message": "You missed some context. The idea here is to make cherry-picking the truncating change into r1b5 easier by undoing the Target line before the change and redoing it after. Thatâ€™s why it goes back to Target: again.\n\nI have gone to this much trouble because I donâ€™t want this string to change in R1B5 only because if it does it will be untranslated. In master and going forwards this is fine, the translations will get updated. Iâ€™m only trying to undo this change temporarily to get mine into R1B5 without it. If you look at the screenshot on #18999 for example it says Naar in Dutch, I donâ€™t want to wreck that just before release.",
