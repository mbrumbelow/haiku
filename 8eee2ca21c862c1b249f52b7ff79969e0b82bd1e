      "message": "So, what we were doing here is locating the first node of type DEVICE_PATH_MESSAGING and truncating the path there. Now we will always be preserving the full path. Is that the right thing to do?\n\nOne reason I see why this could fail is that devicePath may not be in memory we are supposed to modify? Shouldn\u0027t we do this on a copy of the path instead?\n\nIn any case I would appreciate a little more detail on what this code was doing before and what it\u0027s doing now.",
