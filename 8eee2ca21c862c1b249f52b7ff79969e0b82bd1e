      "message": "So, what we were doing here is locating the first node of type DEVICE_PATH_MESSAGING and truncating the path there. Now we will always be preserving the full path. Is that the right thing to do?\n\nOne reason I see why this could fail is that devicePath may not be in memory we are supposed to modify? Shouldn\u0027t we do this on a copy of the path instead?\n\nIn any case I would appreciate a little more detail on what this code was doing before and what it\u0027s doing now.",

      "message": "I think there are actually EFI methods to modify a device path, should maybe look into whether that fixes the hanging. But yes, essentially was attempting to go from a device path to the partition to the device path of the parent, which would hopefully be the full disk. There may be a better way to achieve that though. Would need to go back to the UEFI spec, see what options are available.",
