      "message": "This is definitely an api / abi breaking change.   The get_cpu_topology calls are haiku-specific and not BeOS comapt however.\n\nFrom a api standpoint, storing the CPU vendor as a string makes a lot more sense over an arbitrary enum... especially since companies come and go.  (ex: we have Sun Microsystems vendor for SPARC... except Sun Microsystems is no longer a company that exists.  Are we going to keep Sun as a enum forever for api compatibility?\n\nThat\u0027s some of the logic behind this change.  Instead of trying to track every manufacturer of silicon in an enum, we should just use a reasonable sized string.\n\n\"Intel\" is \"Intel\" and can be compared against.  It\u0027s not scientific, but it will stand the test of time better.",

      "message": "We already discussed that for ARM, the CPU vendor is always ARM as they are the one doing the CPU cores, except in the case of Apple who designed their own cores for the M1.\n\nThat\u0027s the info you want here, so then you can dig into deeper details. It is an ARM core design. Is it a Cortex A57? Is it an old ARM926EJS?\n\nWhat you have listed is not CPU vendors but system-on-chip vendors, and that info has nothing to do in the CPU core info struct.\n\nThe situation might be a bit different for RISC-V but there are not that many companies designing CPU cores, at least in the range we can hope to run Haiku on (there are more for smaller embedded devices).",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think it\u0027s that clear cut.  Think about AMD technically licensing Intel\u0027s x86 patents with that argument.  Things rapidly get into a weird gray area under this logic. Agreements between silicon and IP licensees being determinate of the contents of this array makes everything fuzzy and undefined.\n\nThe original intent of these enums were physical manufacturers as multiple historically \"merged\" companies like Cyrix and National Semiconductor in the enum.\n\nI think as an alternative, the enum growing exponentially based on physical chip manufacturers is fine too, however identifying vendors by arbitrary integers (not based on any standard) seems just as random as identifying them by defined strings.\n\nAs for performance concerns about using a string vs an int.  I really don\u0027t think we\u0027re rapidly parsing the cpu vendor over and over.  If we are, we\u0027re doing something wrong.",
