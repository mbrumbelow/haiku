This means the pointer is left pointing to nothing.\n\nYou need to make sure the settings remain allocated:\n\nMouseSettings* mouseSettings \u003d new MouseSettings(*settings);\nfMouseSettingsObject.insert(std::pair\u003cBString, MouseSettings*\u003e(deviceName, mouseSettings));\n\nAnd in the destructor you need to release the memory for all of these:\n\nfor (itr \u003d fMouseSettingsObject.begin(); itr !\u003d fMouseSettingsObject.end(); ++itr) {\n    delete itr-\u003esecond;\n}",
