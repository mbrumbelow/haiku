      "message": "I\u0027ve been tempted of down vote myself, but we haven\u0027t an agreement yet. \n\nThe idea of this patch, was to make room for media keys, because 128 keys were on the limit. I added 128 more but yes, perhaps 32 were more than enough.\n\nThing is, media keys are not keys (from HID perspective), are consumer events. Many OS seem to fake them as key strokes but I don\u0027t agree with them :)\n\nOn the other hand, if we consider them keys we don\u0027t have to map them into the keymap and send key strokes as unmapped key events, as we already do with F1-F12.",

Do you mean if we don\u0027t consider them keys?\n\nIt sounds to me like unmapped key events are better, but can we set these events to fixed values?\n\nI think this is something we should solve, thanks for the good explanation.",

      "message": "The other part of this change (not sure why we have this scattered in many commits) adds 34 key definitions: https://review.haiku-os.org/c/haiku/+/1695\nSo 32 wouldn\u0027t be enough.\n\nThe idea there was to map all these to B_FUNCTION_KEY and then use the raw keycode to decide which one it is. In that case, they wouldn\u0027t really need to go through the keymap, as long as they are \"mapped\" to B_FUNCTION_KEY in some other way (this can be hardcoded somewhere).\n\n\u003e Thing is, media keys are not keys (from HID perspective), are consumer events. Many OS seem to fake them as key strokes but I don\u0027t agree with them :)\n\nThe advantage of this is it is reasonably simple to do and doesn\u0027t introduce any new APIs. That makes it easy for app developers to handle these events at least for the simple cases (volume control and the like). I agree that HID allows for some more things, but they are rarely used and we can consider them later once we have something in place.",
