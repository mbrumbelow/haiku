      "message": "This color wasn\u0027t used at all. It was overridden with a hardcoded (0, 0, 0) a few lines below and used as text color. I made it use the DOCUMENT_TEXT color directly, because it\u0027s used for the text, and removed the pointless override. The background is now set in line 40. If the idea of using panel background was to change the background color, that didn\u0027t actually work here, the background was always white no matter what color I changed in preferences.",
