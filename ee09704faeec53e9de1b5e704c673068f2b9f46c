I also need assistance with testing the history functionality. There\u0027s a strange issue where a BEntry fails the Exists() check even though it is present on the drive. Could someone review the logic in the ClearHistory function? I tried to identify any logical errors but couldn\u0027t find any. There might be a mistake on my part.\n\nAs discussed before, I also did remove the icon.",
