      "message": "They\u0027re going to potentially differ per architecture. For example the arm version has code around loading a .ub instead of an .efi. \n\nalso, someone making modifications to the u-boot script may not be able to test on \"all potential architectures\" changes impact before committing.\n\nI agree in theory though.  Maybe once these ports get more stabilized we\u0027ll move to a single unified u-boot script?",
