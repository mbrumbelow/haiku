      "message": "As discussed in earlier comments, this should not be enabled for 32bit x86 because it is not needed (we can generate stacktrace without a frame pointer) and it has a larger performance hit (due to using up a register when there aren\u0027t many).\n\nMarking as -1 for now as I think the patch should be modified to not affect 32bit x86. We definitely want to do this on all other architectures.",
