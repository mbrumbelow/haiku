      "message": "IMHO we should replace our printf implementations with musl\u0027s, as there are probably other issues like this that we should correct. However, I think even the ancient version here contains some of the glibc-specific extensions that musl doesn\u0027t support like %L for %ll.\n\nI think most of the important ones are aliases like that, so it may be possible to import the code wholesale and add some #ifdefs to support such flags. But in the meantime this change may be OK, I guess...",
