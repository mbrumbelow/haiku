      "message": "The point of the device manager is to avoid loading all drivers when probing devices (this is how it works in the BeOS API, each driver gets asked \"do you handle this device?\").\n\nIt can\u0027t be an API, because the point is to do some filtering *before* we load any driver. Who would call the API then?\n\nWe are due for a larger refactor here when we start working on non-PCI devices tree (FDT and OpenFirmware)",

      "message": "As Adrien pointed out, there can\u0027t be an API. However, there should be a text based configuration rather than having those things hard coded (it could still serve as a fallback in case there is no configuration file).\n\nThis should be \"packagefs-able\", that is, any number of files are allowed to compile the configuration from. USB and ACPI should already have triggered the redesign of this part, but they somehow haven\u0027t achieved that yet :-)",
