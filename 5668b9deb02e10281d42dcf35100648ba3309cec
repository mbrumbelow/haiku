      "message": "I am confused by this change. As you take from the POSIX spec, it should not fail if the protocol supports binding to a new address. The code you remove does exactly that: it tries to unbind from an address.\n\nArguably, the original code was correct, up to lie 1013 where it returned the status from the unbind command. Arguably, this should be B_BAD_VALUE instead of the unbind error value. Though it might be worth investigating if any of the error conditions of the unbind call should map to another error.",
