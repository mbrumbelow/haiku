      "message": "Switching to 3.12 as the default Python might not be entirely trivial, due to deprecated/removed modules, and the usual changes in Python packaging tooling/ecosystem (among changes around the GIL, \"fork vs spawn\", etc).\n\nMoving to 3.12 for beta5 would also mean updating most/all _python3x packages on HaikuPorts, to avoid having to install 3.10 anyway.\n\nIf it was up to me... I would stay with 3.10.x for beta5, given the following:\n\n- Is has been a solid version so far. Well supported by most python projects.\n- Its issues in Haiku are known, not show-stoppers, and not fixed in newer ones.\n- First version where REPL/history/line-editing work fine in Haiku!\n- Besides some speed improvements, 3.11 and 3.12 do not introduce \"must have\" features that we can\u0027t wait for, IMO.\n- It will get EOL\u0027ed just in Oct 2026, giving us time to decide to either switch to 3.12, or 3.13 that will get released next October.\n\nAlso, I haven\u0027t been as active as previously, so the speed of \"*_python3x\" packages updates might not be fast enough, unless others decide to work on that.",
