      "message": "Your argument is that macos does this, but this is not specific to tracker obviously. If you want command+backspace to equal delete this should be specific to mac keyboards or a customization you, as a user, can add to the shortcut preferences. It should not be added to every application, if this is added to tracked would you add it to ShowImage too? to Mail? etc.\n\nIIRC there is already a wip patch for #7078 in gerrit. But regardless this does not need to ve in this patch, removing command-t seems uncontroversial so we should do that, delete not beeing mentioned in the menu bar is a minor cisual bug we can fix after #7078. The good thing here is that the keycap already describes what the key does.",
