      "message": "We are arguing different things, and this will also resolve the issue of matching different apps. Plain old Delete, and plain old Backspace will continue to function to delete files in Tracker regardless if we make this shortcut Cmd+Delete, Cmd+Backspace, keep it Cmd+T or go hog wild and change it to Cmd+B (although I\u0027d like to use that one for bold in the future, but that\u0027s another story).\n\nThis PR only affects the shortcut that appears in the menu. Hacks to get around the limitations of #7078 (really just setting the shortcut a different way) will remain in place at least until #7078 is fixed, and probably indefinitely.\n\nMy argument for Cmd+Backspace as the shortcut in Tracker is that it is more in line with the spirit of what Be was trying to do, and thus it is what we should do. Most of the devs (ok all but me) don\u0027t seem to care very much about this or see it that way and would prefer plain old delete to appear in the menu instead of trying to follow Be\u0027s vision.\n\nI realize that the shortcut for this that Be actually made was and remains to this day T so you could argue that Be intended the shortcut to be T but I don\u0027t think so. Be simply didn\u0027t have a shortcut character to display for backspace or delete so they made it T instead. I have recently rectified that limitation in Haiku so now we are free to follow Be\u0027s vision, or not, but either way change this shortcut.\n\nThe question remains, should the shortcut be cmd+backspace or delete. The answer to that is that the shortcut cannot be delete until the limitation imposed by #7078 is fixed, so the other option is Cmd+Backspace, or as I have updated this PR to do against my better judgement, Cmd+Delete.\n\nSo why are you -1\u0027ing my PR?

      "message": "\u003e The blatant and obvious truth is that I want it to work like Mac OS and I do not apologize for that.\n\nYou do not need to apologize for that, however I would really like you to answer the question what prevents you from implementing this as an input server filter or in your keymap, as I\u0027ve suggested twice in this change (as have pulkomandy and waddlesplash, the keymap version that is)\n\n\u003e You cannot navigate via arrow keys in any Haiku menu, you are prevented from assign arrow keys to shortcuts by the system.\n\nThat is incorrect. You can use single keys to interact with Deskbar, with tracker too (arrow up, arrow down, the delete key).\nYou can interact with MediaPlayer like this, with ShowImage etc.\nThe *only* difference is that currently it cannot be shown in the menu. This is a cosmetic bug at best, not a throughly thought out design decision. \n\n\u003e You can be mad as you want and downvote this PR harder but it won’t change the verifiable and invariable truth. \n\nI think this kind of behaviour is what Rene ment above with \"trying to constantly frame yourself as being right and everyone else being wrong\"\n\nThe terminology here is a bit vague and confusing, as is the issue itself.\n\nIf a shortcut requires cmd then the single keys simply aren\u0027t shortcuts per definition.\nOr are they only shortcuts if they are visible in the menu etc etc.\n\nIt makes little sense to split hairs over the definitions to call others wrong. Let\u0027s just discuss this on a technical merrit, this should be in the keymap or input server as a filter.\n\nCan you agree to that?\n\nAnother option would to let the input server generate shortcuts instead, sending a message like say copy requested when cmd c is hit to an application and attach the generating shortcut so if the app has something bound to it the BApplication will simply overwrite it. Would be a more elaborate implementation but allow \"shortcuts\" to be configure on the input server layer directly.",

      "message": "An input server filter is not needed at all in this case but don’t you see how this question assumes that Delete is correct and Cmd+Backspace is alternative. This is untrue, Delete is the alternative and it is not allowed as a shortcut.\n\nWhat I said is correct, you cannot assign arrow keys to any menu just as I cannot assign plain old delete to this shortcut. You say it’s a cosmetic bug but it’s not a bug at all, it’s a deliberate and intentional design decision, it is just one you don’t like, understand or care about.\n\nYou are still framing this as if Delete is the correct option and backspace is the weird alternative when the opposite is the case. Your prefers is weird and alternative, mine is the correct choice for several reasons I’ve already gone over. There is no need for an input server filter since both keys already are assigned the delete action in this case.\n\nThe reality here is that you guys are twisting my arm and forcing me accept your shortcut preference while you pretend it’s not a preference but somehow is fundamentally correct even though it is literally impossible to do because it doesn’t fit into the intentional and deliberate design of the system and you also demand that the intentional and deliberate design of the shortcut system be changed rather than accepting that Cmd+backspace as the shortcut combination for this action.\n\nI’ve attempted to “fix” #7078 once again and I ran into the same issue I did last time I tried. I can assign a shortcut without command to the menu, but the shortcut won’t actually be triggered without command present and I’m not quite sure why that is the case.",
