      "message": "Your argument is that macos does this, but this is not specific to tracker obviously. If you want command+backspace to equal delete this should be specific to mac keyboards or a customization you, as a user, can add to the shortcut preferences. It should not be added to every application, if this is added to tracked would you add it to ShowImage too? to Mail? etc.\n\nIIRC there is already a wip patch for #7078 in gerrit. But regardless this does not need to ve in this patch, removing command-t seems uncontroversial so we should do that, delete not beeing mentioned in the menu bar is a minor cisual bug we can fix after #7078. The good thing here is that the keycap already describes what the key does.",

So I guess the reason is that you prefer the Delete key is that it is associated with Move To Trash linguistically, ok fair enough, either way it\u0027s better than T.\n\nThe only reason it\u0027s Cmd+Backspace or Cmd+Delete or Cmd+T is that the Command is currently required for all shortcuts. That\u0027s not really a bug per-say it\u0027s a design choice, a design choice that was almost certainly made with Mac OS of that era in mind but it\u0027s not wrong, it\u0027s just... different. Anyway, until that design choice is altered, Cmd+Delete is the best I can do.\n\nI want to remove the Mac/PC keyboard idea from the discussion, this has very little to do with either Macintosh keyboards or PC keyboards, it\u0027s a design choice and choosing whether we should choose a shortcut that tries to fit into the current design or not.",
