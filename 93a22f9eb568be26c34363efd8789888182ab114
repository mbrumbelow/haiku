      "message": "I just tried our old IPv6 checksum computation with ChatGPT, and it actually identifies its issues. However, it has the following remarks to the new one:\n\n\"This code is also not correct for computing an IPv6 checksum. The IPv6 checksum is calculated differently than the IPv4 checksum. It should be computed using the pseudo-header concept, which includes the source and destination addresses, payload length, and the next header field. Also, the final checksum should be the one\u0027s complement of the sum. I recommend to use a well-tested library to compute the checksum, instead of writing your own implementation.\"\n\nI must admit, I haven\u0027t looked into the issue myself :-)",
