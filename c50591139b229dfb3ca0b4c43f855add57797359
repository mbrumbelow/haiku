      "message": "hm. ok so instead of setting the fdt to fdtcontroladdr, you\u0027re adjusting the fdt_addr_r variable to point to the fdtcontroladdr pointer.\n\nI get it now.   I\u0027m assuming u-boot\u0027s fdt command automatically assumes the pointer value in fdt_addr_r at boot? (I don\u0027t see you calling it)",

      "message": "As explained in the previous comment from Heinrich:\n\n\u003e The logic currently built into the bootefi command of U-Boot is as follows:\n\n\u003e If an FDT address (typically $fdt_addr_r) is passed as second argument use that.\n\u003e Else if $fdtaddr is set use the device tree at that address.\n\u003e Else use the devicetree at $fdtcontroladdr.\n\nSo, all we need to do is make sure a device tree is available at any one of these addresses. fdtaddr and fdtcontroladdr require nothing special, since they are automatically loaded (by uboot or by some lower level bootloader). The only one we need to fill is fdt_addr_r when loading the FDT from FAT manually.\n\nThere is no need to call the fdt command at all, bootefi takes care of it. This is also documented in the bootefi command documentation: https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/bootefi.html\n\nAlso, do we still want to preserve the bootm version? Or are we switching to EFI-only? That would allow to simplify this script a bit more.",
