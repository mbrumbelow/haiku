      "message": "This change does have a downside in that it does hit the kernel heap. However, hash-table insertion can (will) also do that, too, so I don\u0027t know if we should really worry about that too much.\n\nThis also does open the possibility of switching the user mutex table to use a r/w lock, and then only W locking during insertion (all other locking would be R only). Heavily contended mutexes would then not be \"serialized\" through a single lock in the kernel.",
