      "message": "This exposes fonts a bit differently than before in the menu.\nFor Shantell sans for example there was \"ShantellSans Irregular\" with variants in it\u0027s own menu. Now each variant is under one \"Shantellsans\" menu.\n\nRegardless, I think this is fine to merge as is. It works in my testing and will allow us to heavily cut down the noto font\u0027s weight (in bytes).",
