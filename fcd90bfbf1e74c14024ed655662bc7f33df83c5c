      "message": "i suppose the reason for that is that gerrit refuses to accept a push when the committer email address isn\u0027t registered, the exact reason why i couldn\u0027t upload the patch myself (noreply address can\u0027t be registered in gerrit as a confirmation mail is required) and asked ethan to do it for me, assuming he already got an account.\n\nbut maybe this can be fixed via git commit --amend --author\u003d\"rofl0r \u003cemail@here\u003e\", so ethan\u0027s email is preserved as committer while authorship is properly attributed.",
