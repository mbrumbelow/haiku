      "message": "Width and height were already hardcoded, just look at the code: when right border value is (frame.right + 200) and the left border value is (frame.right - 150) you see the width is fixed to 350 units, BUT it is not easy to read, nor easy to modify.\n\nCalculation/placement: I can revert that part, just are you so sure the previous placement (always crossing the right border of the main window, regardless of its desktop position) had a rationale better than showing a dialog almost centered into its main window?",
