If this patchset looks ok then I\u0027ll look into the BDataIO/memory loading aspect.  \n\nAlso if I have a small test app / unit test for this, would it be appropriate to put it into the repo under tests/servers/apps/ ?  \n",

      "message": "The user fonts are *technically* globally available but don\u0027t show up in any interface kit queries.  In Appearance-\u003eFont preferences, they don\u0027t appear, nor any app that queries font directories (CharacterMap, StyledEdit, etc.).  However any app can probably try to reference a user font via the styleID/familyID but that would be odd for an app to try to set a BFont to a random user font. \n\nThe reason they are not available is because of the lost family reference.",

I know it creates a new Family for every user font but that was a tradeoff.  If this is a bad idea then I need to figure out a better way to keep the user fonts separate from the system fonts.\n\nRelated question: should a user font be able to be added to a system font family?  Like if Noto Sans -\u003e Regular is a system font, and I add Noto Sans -\u003e Super Italic Bold as a user font, should that be accessible within the app under Noto Sans?  Or do we keep user families separate from system families?",
