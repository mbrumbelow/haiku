      "message": "Not really. It\u0027s just some patching that is hard to fix depending on how big ACPICA changes were, and then re-applying some fixes.\nMost issues have been with the embedded controller and the lock between hardware and software, often shown by 100% CPU when lock isn\u0027t working. Old ACPI implementations was also a pain in itself, but almost no one use that kind of hardware anymore.",
