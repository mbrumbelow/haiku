Not much overlap at this point.\n\nEventually we could use ACPI+FDT for arm32/arm64/riscv64 but the x86 is still a bit more complex as it can have ACPI enabled or disabled and in the latter case there should be a fallback mechanism (see review 5182)\n\nI was trying to carve out this patch such that it does not change existing behavior.",
