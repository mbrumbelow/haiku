      "message": "A quick test on the packaged system/apps/ folder says it works nicely.\n\nOne thing only somewhat related to this change\u0027s subject: There\u0027s no way to copy a filename from a read-only volume anymore (short of installing the CopyNameToClipboard Tracker addon).\nIt\u0027d be nice if there was at least some way, e.g. from the GetInfo panel. On writable files, you can click on the filename in that panel and the string turns into an editable text field. Maybe keep that and just make it un-editable, but copy-able?",
