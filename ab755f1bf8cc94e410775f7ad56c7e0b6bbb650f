      "message": "Yeah _kern_read_link doesn\u0027t do the correct thing here.\n\nTo make this work without the extra buffer we\u0027d need to change bfs_read_link(), which currently does this.\n\n    if (linkLen \u003c *_bufferSize)\n    \t*_bufferSize \u003d linkLen;\n\nIf I change it to something like this:\nhttps://github.com/ambroff/haiku/commit/0a0c538ff59e383ab36047614a675604a9405c69\n\nThen of course BsymLink::ReadLink will work without the extra buffer. But I\u0027ll need to check to see what else will break with that change cause I\u0027m sure it will be something.\n\nI haven\u0027t had time to look at this all week but I\u0027ll figure it out this weekend.",
