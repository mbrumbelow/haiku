      "message": "The multiplications and divisions are done entirely in DefaultMediaTheme. This is done to have a fine-grained \"continuous\" slider with an arbitrary range.\n\nBut the inside of ChannelSlider shouldn\u0027t rely on this in the current situation, especially as it is a public class documented in the Haiku book and inherited from BeOS (so, other things outside of Haiku may use it).\n\nSolutions are:\n\n- Extend ChannelSlider to support scaling internally, so that the DefaultMediaTheme doesn\u0027t need to emulate it\n- Allow the user of ChannelSlider to set a custom value tooltip or a custom formatting function for the value, and use that in DefaultMediaTheme to do the \"conversion\"\n\nEither way, all the multiply and divide by 1000 will be grouped in a single place, making it easier to reuse code.",
