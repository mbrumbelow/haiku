      "message": "From my initial testing last night, the SD card I put in now shows up, mounts, and reads. The issue was when I tried to format a new partition. I was able to initialize a new GPT and define a 100M EFI partition, but formatting it crashes.\nThe message is \"Command execution unwise, data inhibit\", which you can `co` through a few times to get back to a working system. Unfortunately, the SD card won\u0027t work for reading or writing after that, just causing the same crash. oops!\nI\u0027ve also looked at other SDHCI implementations, and as far as I can tell, they can tell if a controller is for SD/SDHC/SDIO/EMMC based on pairs of ACPI HID and UID.",
