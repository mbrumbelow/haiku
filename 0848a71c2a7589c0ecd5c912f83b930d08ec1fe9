Indeed the documentation for ioctl says there is only a 3-argument form, and the reason for the varargs in the POSIX prototype is to allow the 3rd argument to be either a pointer or an integer. https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/ioctl.html\n\n\u003e The arg argument represents additional information that is needed by this specific STREAMS device to perform the requested function. The type of arg depends upon the particular control request, but it shall be either an integer or a pointer to a device-specific data structure.\n\nIt seems the best fix is to deprecate ioctl and implement posix_devctl which will be added in the next POSIX standard to have an explicit pointer and size passed to the function: https://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id\u003d729 (so it looks like we are not the only one seeing problems with this).",
