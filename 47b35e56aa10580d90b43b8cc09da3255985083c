      "message": "This came back but I pretty much fixed the issue in BTextView, there\u0027s just a tiny change here now to call AdoptSystemColors() after MakeEditable() is false because I had the idea to tint the colors like I did in Tracker for MakeEditable(false). I thought about using panel colors instead of document colors to appear disabled, but I tinted instead because I figure you might change your panel colors to something that wouldn\u0027t look uneditable anymore and you\u0027d lose the effect.",

      "message": "I agree with Waddlesplash, it should not be needed to re-adopt the system colors every time you make a view editable or non-editable.\n\nWhat should happen is:\n\n- You construct the view, attach it to a window and call AdoptSystemColors()\n- After this, calling MakeEditable(true/false) should switch between the system (ui_color based) editable and non-editable colors, without having to do anything else.\n\nIn this specific case it doesn\u0027t really matter, because the view is switched to not editable mode only once. But in other places where it is switched dynamically, it would be more of a problem. And even if dynamic switching doesn\u0027t happen often, allowing AdoptSystemColors to be called before MakeEditable removes one possibility of having a bug and wasting developers time.",
