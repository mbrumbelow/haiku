      "message": "I still like the look of the current check mark glyphs better but I don‚Äôt want to hold up progress. We can replace the glyphs from a better font later on. The idea of using HVIF icons misses the mark (hehe) because text is easily scalable and colorable. We want monochrome glyphs in the menu so that they aren‚Äôt distracting.",

      "message": "I am a bit annoyed by this, if your complaint is \"the glyph is bad\" or \"I don\u0027t like the look\", there is nothing I can do to improve it because \"bad\" is subjective.\n\nThe hint you gave is to look at the checkmark in Jetbrains Mono. So I looked that up and... it doesn\u0027t appear to include a checkmark glyph: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono?preview.text\u003d%E2%9C%93%E2%9C%93%E2%9C%93%E2%9C%93%E2%9C%93\u0026query\u003djetbrains+mono\n\nI agree that the Noto Sans Symbols 2 is way too detailed, but at typical font sizes for me, it hardly makes any difference. So I\u0027m not sure what to do. It sounds like this should be reported to Noto, and is independant of this change?",

It is a bit like if you just said \"this code looks bad, here is a better algorithm\" and gave me a dead link and no explanation about why that supposed algorithm would be better. That is not a review I can use to improve the situation. As a result, there is nothing I can do here, and a problem that I don\u0027t understand, and that\u0027s frustrating.",
