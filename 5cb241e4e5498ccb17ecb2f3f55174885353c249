      "message": "Personally, I like the \"Switch shortcut keys\" button. It makes it really easy for users to do one task that they might commonly want to do. I think it\u0027s appropriate that \"Switch shortcuts\" is hidden in a menu, since I think very, very few people would want to do anything other than switching the shortcut keys to Windows/Linux mode.\n\nBut maybe I\u0027m missing something here. I\u0027m aware that keyboard layouts can look quite different but have no experience with them. Thoughts?",
