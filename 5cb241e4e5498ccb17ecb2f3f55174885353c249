      "message": "Personally, I like the \"Switch shortcut keys\" button. It makes it really easy for users to do one task that they might commonly want to do. I think it\u0027s appropriate that \"Switch shortcuts\" is hidden in a menu, since I think very, very few people would want to do anything other than switching the shortcut keys to Windows/Linux mode.\n\nBut maybe I\u0027m missing something here. I\u0027m aware that keyboard layouts can look quite different but have no experience with them. Thoughts?",

      "message": "The problem is the existence of 2 paths to do the same thing. What should happen if I adapt the modifiers and also press the \"Switch shortcut keys\" button? I find it quite confusing, both for the user and for the developer. IMHO the \u0027Set modifier keys\" is quite clear and far more flexible. If the \"Switch shortctus\" is still wanted let\u0027s think how it should behave in the presence of modifiers remapping.",

      "message": "I believe having two paths to do the same thing here is fine. Probably almost all of the people customizing the keymap will just want to swap control and alt key. Few users would be doing much more. Having a \"Set modifier keys\" button there instead would obscure that customization to non-power users who may not realize that swapping the ctrl and alt key will work.\n\n\u003e What should happen if I adapt the modifiers and also press the \"Switch shortcut keys\" button?\n\nInteresting corner case... Gray out the switch shortcut keys button? Just make it set the keys regardless of the customizations? So many possibilities... Maybe it\u0027s not worth worry about it since it\u0027s such a rare case?",

      "message": "Some rando thoughts:\n\nI fail to see why \"Switch shortcuts\" is easier than \"Set modifier keys\". You need to know what \"Haiku mode\" and \"Windows/Linux mode\" mean. The modifiers window is much clearer IMHO.\n\nI also consider the validation in the modifies window unnecesary complexity. What if I want to make Caps an additional control? The check for repeated modifiers won\u0027t allow me to configure it that way.\n\nIf you think most use cases are covered by the \"Switch shortcuts\" behaviour, maybe the solution here is to just remove the \"Set modifier keys\" completely and have a separate PowerMods preference installable via HaikuDepot and mentioned in the manual?",
