      "message": "I don\u0027t see any \"printf\" in src/system/kernel. We have a kprintf that does no locking at all and must be used only for the kernel debugger because it uses no locking. dprintf has a lock for a common shared buffer, which seems not great.\n\nI think it would make more sense to change more code to not use dprintf and do their own buffering (sprintf + debug_puts) so we don\u0027t have everything competing for this single lock and buffer?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know why this is there, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be an usable printf implementation. It could probably be implemented using the already existing dprintf_args, however, so the TODO seems obsolete.\n\nGeneric line buffering is tricky to implement, do we really want something that complicated in kernel debug code? What would be the plan, a static buffer with a fixed maximal line length? How to handle locking to access that buffer? What if multiple threads try to use line buffered output simultaneously? Do we still interlace their messages?",
