      "message": "I don\u0027t see any \"printf\" in src/system/kernel. We have a kprintf that does no locking at all and must be used only for the kernel debugger because it uses no locking. dprintf has a lock for a common shared buffer, which seems not great.\n\nI think it would make more sense to change more code to not use dprintf and do their own buffering (sprintf + debug_puts) so we don\u0027t have everything competing for this single lock and buffer?",
