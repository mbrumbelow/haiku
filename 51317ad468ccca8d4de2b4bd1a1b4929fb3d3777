      "message": "I believe the shared part has been extracted to x86/arch_smp.cpp, the 32-bit specific part is located in x86/arch_smp_32.cpp, the 64-bit specific part is located in x86_64/arch_smp_64.cpp.\n\narch_timer.cpp has been refactored previously hrev55815.\n\narch_mmu.cpp and relocation_func.cpp don\u0027t have much in common.\n\narch_start.cpp does have things in common but I\u0027d rather touch that in a separate changeset (if at all, as it seems to share code across all architectures)\n\nIs there any additional refactoring that you think is missing?",
