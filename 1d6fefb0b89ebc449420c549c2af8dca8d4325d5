      "message": "I do not know much about how `VMCache` works, but:\n- I have tested this patch and it does not seem to break anything.\n- It seems safe to unlock the cache at that point since `unmap_address_range` does not modify any of `cache`\u0027s attributes. If it does, it seems to acquire its own locks.\n- `cache` is also protected from being deleted since `map_backing_store`\u0027s callers all own a reference to `cache`. After the call to `unmap_address_range`, `cache` is only kept to add the current area to the cache; no properties are needed at that point, so temporarily releasing the lock should not cause any unwanted effects.",
