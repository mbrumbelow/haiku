Deeply ingrained in muscle memory, thumb always hovering near ALT and fingers near Q,W,E,S,A keys, it\u0027s more convenient than going to F2. At least I have to keep looking on the keyboard to hit the seldom used Fkey.\nIt was OK to have F2 as additional shortcut when it was added, but the Windows user appeasing stops here. What\u0027s next, CTRL+F4 instead of ALT+Q? ðŸ˜Š",

      "message": "I agree. In addition to this, function keys may be hard to use (need to be pressed with Fn key etc.) or not exist at all on some keyboards.\n\nAlso I would recommend to separate patch sets to apply core changes that not affect existing behavior first. It would help to speed up code review.",
