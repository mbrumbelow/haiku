We do builds out-of-tree and Jam can\u0027t be invoked in build sub-directories since we don\u0027t keep Jamfiles there.\n\nSince the entire objects directory is removed on cleaning after the previous change, there is no reason to also clean the files individually.\n\nAm I missing something about jam clean\u0027s usage? Thanks!",
