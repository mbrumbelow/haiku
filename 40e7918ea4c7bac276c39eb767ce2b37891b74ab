I would expect there\u0027s no functional change, I even tried checking whether this would get optimized away by the compiler itself by rebuilding this, just to be extra sure, and this seemed to be the case. What did I miss? Was the original implementation incorrect to begin with, should err be returned if it\u0027s not equal to B_OK?",
