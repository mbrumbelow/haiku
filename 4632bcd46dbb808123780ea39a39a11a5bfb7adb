      "message": "Hello Adrien; I have had a look at this API and have experimented with it.  If I look at the constants for `path_base_directory` they are all system level top-level directoies, but I am trying to get the data to cache into `~/config/cache/HaikuDepot/...`.  I don\u0027t see a way to use this API to achieve this?",

      "message": "It works differently from find_directory, and the constants are not specific to system or home-based. The idea is that it will find the \"right\" cache directory for the application calling the function. So a non-packaged application would get B_SYSTEM_NONPACKAGED_CACHE_DIRECTORY, a packaged application installed in /system would get B_SYSTEM_CACHE_DIRECTORY, etc.\n\nIt is indeed not possible to get to the user-cache directory from a system-wide application this way. Is there a reason you are doing this, however? Is the data stored here not shareable between users?\n\nIf so, then your implementation is fine.",

      "message": "It is an interesting question as to where the caches *should* be stored.  The application was originally written such that the caches were stored at `~/config/cache/HaikuDepot/...` and I have never considered changing the location to a system-wide one.  I guess if the data were to be shared between users then I ought to introduce locking across that directory at startup etc... a bit more work than I want to get into here in this change.  I\u0027d rather leave the locations as is for now.",
