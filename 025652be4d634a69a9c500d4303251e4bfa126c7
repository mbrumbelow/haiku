Same combo is used in Tracker for icon size and ShowImage to zoom.\nMaybe all those zoom levels and the new \"Increase\" and \"Decrease\" could be moved into a \"Zoom\" submenu.\n\n\u003e Or should we really implement menu shortcuts without modifiers?\n\nYes.

      "message": "nephele: The new options are of course mapped to Alt or Ctrl as per you system settings (hmm, maybe your comment was a reply to PulkoMandy\u0027s open question though?).\n\nAll: Note that the existing fixed scale factors were already set via Modifier 0-4 (nb. I didn\u0027t assign one for the new 25% option though), so in that sense maybe it makes sense to also have zoom in/out as Modifier +/- (plus that\u0027s where I would look for it first too to be honest).\n\nAs for non-modifier shortcuts... some potential pitfalls there would be my instinctive reaction, though I haven\u0027t given it much thought previously tbh (it\u0027s also more of a general system thing I guess so arguably outside the scope of this commit).",
