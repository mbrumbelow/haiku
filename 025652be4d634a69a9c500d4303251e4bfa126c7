      "message": "If I read the code correctly, this was already possible (in +10/-10% increments) simply by pressing \u0027+\u0027 and \u0027-\u0027.\n\nWe\u0027re a bit limited for discoverability by the fact that it\u0027s not possible to have menu shortcuts without modifiers, I guess.\n\nI think the existing behavior with +/- is simpler so I\u0027d rather keep that, can we make it easier to discover in some way? Or should we really implement menu shortcuts without modifiers?",

It is not possible anymore to set a 5% size if we wanted to.\n\nI would rather have the message contain a different thing in this case (for example contain \"size\" for absolute percentages to be used with _ResizeWindow, and \"sizeChange\" or \"relativesize\" for use with _ZoomVideoView)",
