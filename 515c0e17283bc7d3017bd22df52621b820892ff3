      "message": "Changes to support more shortcuts types are definitely desired, but it do not mean that existing Haiku built-in programs shortcuts should be changed. New API can be used by 3rd-party programs etc.. There are many users that already get used to BeOS shortcuts and don\u0027t want change.\n\n\"Patchset 82\" in some changes is something wrong, it should be already applied.",
