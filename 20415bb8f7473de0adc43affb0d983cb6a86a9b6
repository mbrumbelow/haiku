      "message": "I don\u0027t understand this change. The weak symbol should be handled as a candidateSymbol at line 529, but we should keep looking for other symbols in case we find a non-weak one.\n\nOnly if the loop exits without finding a non-weak symbol, we end up using the candidateSymbol (at line 545).\n\nWith this change, as soon as we find a weak symbol, we accept it, without checking if another image has a non-weak version that we should use in priority.\n\nSo:\n\n- I don\u0027t understand how this fixes the problem mentionned in the commit message (the symbol should have be found eventually via the candidateSymbol system),\n- It looks like it will break overriding a weak symbol with a non-weak one.",
