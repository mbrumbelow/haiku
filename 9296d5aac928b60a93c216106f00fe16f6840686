      "message": "Good first contribution :-)\n\nI looked into whether it was possible to make the menu item show the `del` shortcut. Alas, it doesn\u0027t look like it since the shortcut will have the `B_COMMAND_KEY` modifier added no matter what.\n\nI\u0027m going to ignore Haiku-format Bot\u0027s code formatting suggestions. Maybe they\u0027re good ideas, but I\u0027m leaning towards not following them. Maybe somebody more experienced will point out a better course of action...\n\nAlso it tested fine. So it\u0027s virtually done. I just noticed one code style improvement that could be done.\n\nBTW, did you figure out you could do `jam -j$(nproc) Icon-O-Matic` to build just the files required for Icon-O-Matic?",

Perhaps the menu for now may be changed as to open to the top instead of to below.\n\nAnyhow, this is not about users beeing forgetfull but rather that the UI flow is harder to understand. If you add something in this menu it appears below, and you have a direct feedback afterwards. But nothing destructive happens. When deleting however and it not beeing clear which list is targeted is much harder to do \"safely\"\n\nIf a user summoned a context menu they know the selected item in any case.\n\nAs a side note for this, it would be nice if Haiku could have some preview options in applications like word added a decade ago. Hover over an item and it will show you what is going to happen, in this instance for example hovering over remove it would highlight with a red outline which items will be deleted, but this is quite unrelated to this change in specific.",

The user clicking on an item in the Transformer list with the intention of deleting it, definitely knows what gets deleted when they choose \"Remove\" from the Transformer menu. Just like when you have selected some text in StyledEdit that gets obscured by the Font menu, doesn\u0027t baffle the user that invoked the Fonts menu to change the font of the selected text.\n\nOne could argue that the whole GUI with lists that have a menu above it is difficult and should be changed. Or that the transformer list shows the transformers of the Shape selected in the list above it, isn\u0027t obvious at first glance.\nBut these are arguments not related to this patch.",
