      "message": "I was inspired from code and comments on MouseDevice::_BuildShortName from input server mouse device add-on.\n\nThat method builds a human friendly device description using only /dev path, ie: Extended PS/2 Mouse 1. It is commented there that would be better asking device for name or special characteristics, like is_touchpad.\n\nI also prefer querying device instead of building the name using a device path heuristic. But it is only my point of view, of course.\n\nWhat about getting vid/pid in a single structure/ioctl? is that ok? Shall I submit another patch with only those two values on ioctl?",
