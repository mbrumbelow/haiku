There are various ways to do it with a macro, but I think this is simple and clear enough and doesn\u0027t get too much in the way of reading the code.\n\nSomething like this would also be possible:\n\n    TRACE_ONLY(uint8 data;)\n    \n    TRACE_ONLY(data \u003d) ps2_read_data();\n    \nBut I find this less nice.",
