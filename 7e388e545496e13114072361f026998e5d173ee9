Or is it something that matters only for NUMA use cases?",

      "message": "I guess that normal memory must be outer shareable if it is accessed by DMA from external devices? But the ARM documentation https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0406/b/Application-Level-Architecture/Application-Level-Memory-Model/Memory-types-and-attributes-and-the-memory-order-model/Summary-of-ARMv7-memory-attributes?lang\u003den says the meaning of outer shareable is implementation defined, so we\u0027ll have to look at documentation for specific CPU core implementations.\n\nIt seems OK to merge this and see if we run into problems later.",
