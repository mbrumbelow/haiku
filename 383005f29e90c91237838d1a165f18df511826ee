      "message": "There\u0027s also the question -- do we even need this menu? It\u0027s used in exactly 1 case: it\u0027s shown when you are dragging something, and hover over a folder, and then right-click. Only it appears to presently be broken, anyway, because doing that opens both this menu *and* the standard right-click menu at once, making both menus unusable.\n\nShould we fix this? If nobody\u0027s noticed, do we decide this \"feature\" isn\u0027t really useful/interesting, and get rid of it? (Is something broken about my test setup, and it does work \u0026 is useful for others?) Something else altogether?",
