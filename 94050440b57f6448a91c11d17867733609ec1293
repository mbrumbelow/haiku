      "message": "Update...(menu) methods are gone now from TShortcuts, you can only update the shortcuts by item now. If you want to find the item in a menu and update it you\u0027ll have to do that yourself which is what I had to do in a few cases.\n\nThe \"Arrange by\" menu has been refactored using the same adding and removing from menu technique as all the other dynamic menus like \"Open with...\", Nav menus, Move to/Copy to/Create link, etc. We share the same \"Arrange by\" menu in multiple places, (really just 2: in the Window menu and in the window context menus) creating it the first time use you use it deleting it at Quit().",
