      "message": "My BWindow::Shortcut::PrepareModifiers() method was a bit too permissive, don\u0027t tack on B_COMMAND_KEY unless you have defined at least one other modifier. You are only supposed to have a bare modifiers-less shortcut if you specify B_NO_COMMAND_KEY. This was tacking on B_COMMAND_KEY to and activating the shortcut with regular keypresses if you had Caps Lock on because then the modifier was set. Whoops. Ok now fixed.",
