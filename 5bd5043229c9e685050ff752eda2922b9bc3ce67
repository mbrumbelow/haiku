      "message": "So, B_KERNEL_*_AREA are of course Haiku introductions, and it seems the automatic setting of them both when no KERNEL protections are specified is also a \"Haiku-ism\" which dates to 2004, when the NewOS kernel protection flags were reworked in to B_KERNEL_*_AREA instead: https://github.com/haiku/haiku/commit/3c9e531071970667a68648a47faf0c1d5e9d1a6b#diff-f743c9de3d0d391f73c78c5ecad4a7056e9088b01b773b5f5ad76880cdc5c4feR2488\n\nThis change is thus likely safe to make. Whatever other fallout there is (e.g. other drivers) can be dealt with as it comes up.",
