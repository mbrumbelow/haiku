Does the meaning depend on context? Or is it always acutally Sector? The code \"looked\" clear before, now it \"looks\" buggy, as if taking the wrong size for blocks.",

      "message": "There should either be two flags here (which I\u0027d prefer), or the flag needs to become \"B_PARTITION_CHANGED_BLOCK_OR_SECTOR_SIZE\".\n\nAlso, I think there should be new members SectorSize() and SetSectorSize(). It looks wrong and asymmetrical that methods are used above, and then \"private\" member access to do something very similar in the next code block.",
