      "message": "First I thought Iâ€™d add a global setting that toggles the setting. I still think about it. But most of all, I think this should be exposed to the developers; it is part of the API, and also there are cases that separated formatting looks weird. For instance, in the PID section of Slayer, a raw, non-separated value looks more familiar, while giving us automatic digit conversion for languages like Arabic.\n\nDo you have any idea how to solve this for integers? Looks like there is no API available.",

      "message": "setGroupingUsed is available (and you already used it), and that seems like a valid use for it.\n\nBut I\u0027m still not sure changing the group size is useful.\n\nThe formatter is most likely a DecimalFormat like the one for floating point, and can be configured in the same way (dynamic_cast to DecimalFormat). I don\u0027t think there are any locales not using some kind of decimal digits (roman numerals? spelling out the value as \"one thousand and thirty-six\"? both of these would probably use a RuleBasedNumberFormat). You have already added the NULL pointer checks needed to handle that case.",
