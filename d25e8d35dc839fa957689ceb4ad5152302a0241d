      "message": "First I thought I’d add a global setting that toggles the setting. I still think about it. But most of all, I think this should be exposed to the developers; it is part of the API, and also there are cases that separated formatting looks weird. For instance, in the PID section of Slayer, a raw, non-separated value looks more familiar, while giving us automatic digit conversion for languages like Arabic.\n\nDo you have any idea how to solve this for integers? Looks like there is no API available.",

I don\u0027t think there are any locales not using some kind of decimal digits (roman numerals? spelling out the value as \"one thousand and thirty-six\"? both of these would probably use a RuleBasedNumberFormat).

I think it’s a valid accessibility case. macOS has this as an accessibility option, but still exposes it to the app developers for individual tuning.\n\nmacOS also exposes all ICU functions to the developers but that’s another discussion.
