      "message": "I don\u0027t understand what you are checking here.\n\nFirst you can replace (blockNumber + 1) * blockSize with remainingLength (they are the same thing).\n\nSo, this is checking if we are trying to read past the file end. I think it will never be the case? And even if we are, why should that result in skipping the while loop below?",

      "message": "It is not correct to read more than 1 block of data at a time here. You need to read at most blockSize bytes, and never more than that. You could even need to read less than that if the initial file_offset is not at the start of a block.\n\nBasically there are only 4 ways you can read from disk with read_pos that make sense:\n- Read a complete block,\n- Read the end of a block,\n- Read the start of a block,\n- Read the middle of a block.\n\nThey are used this way:\n\nIf reading a complete file:\n- Read several (possibly 0, if the file is small) complete blocks until remainingLength \u003c blockSize\n- Read the start of the last block\n\nIf reading a file starting from somewhere in the middle:\n- Read the end of a block\n- Read several (again, possibly 0) complete blocks until remainingLength \u003c blockSize)\n- Read the start of the last block if needed\n\nReading a small part of a file from somewhere in the middle (when *_length passed to the function is smaller than blockSize):\n- Read the middle of a block\n\nSo, what you have to check:\n- Does our read start and end in the same block, or do we need a loop?\n- Does our read start at the start of a block (blockOffset \u003d\u003d 0), or do we need to read only the end of the block?\n- Does our read go until the end of the block, or does it stop before?\n\nThe simplest way to do this seems to be:\n- compute the blockNumber and blockOffset for the start of the read (from file_offset)\n- compute the blockNumber and blockOffset for the end of the read (from file_offset + *_length)\n\n- If the two blockNumbers are equal: you only need to read one block\n  - In that case, read *_length bytes starting from your computed start blockNumber and blockOffset.\n- If they are different: you need to read multiple blocks\n  - In that case, read the first block from its blockNumber and blockOffset, you need to read until the end of the block, so the read size should be blockSize - blockOffset\n  - Then, loop to read more blocks, always reading from the start of the block. Read blockSize bytes each time until remainingLength becomes less than blockSize\n  - Finally, read the last block. Read blockSize bytes from the start of the block.\n\nI hope it is clear now. Make some drawings if needed to better understand the way it works.",
