      "message": "I rebased this change and cleaned it up. However, I now think it\u0027s unnecessary and superfluous. Here\u0027s why:\n\nDouble-clicking an application\u0027s entry already serves to bring the application to the front. This works whether it has one window or many. Admittedly this behavior is undocumented, but it\u0027s there in the code and works just fine, so fixing the documentation and \"spreading the word\" of that feature should not be too hard.\n\nAdditionally, the one-click activation this change introduces has absolutely no visual indicator in Deskbar. If you click on a Deskbar application entry that\u0027s already on top, nothing visually changes and it looks like your click went nowhere. That\u0027s quite confusing. The double-click mechanism on the other hand does open and close the menu in the double-click time.\n\nFurther, this change introduces an inconsistency: right now, if one clicks on a Deskbar menu entry it will open a window entry, and then if one moves the mouse to rest overtop another entry, it will switch the open window menu. But now, if one clicks on such an entry, no window menu will be opened, but that same window menu can be accessed still through the one-click+move mechanism.\n\nIf we decide that the double-click-activate mechanism is \"too many clicks\" then we can do something about that, sure. But otherwise I think it makes more sense to just publicize the existence of that feature.",

      "message": "I concur with the above.\nPersonally, I haven\u0027t used this \u0027newly discovered\u0027 double-clicking feature before. Mainly, because I use the Deskbar in auto-Expando mode and just click on the window directly. I never bothered to collapse an app\u0027s entry if it only has one window. Maybe I\u0027ll do that now if there are many one-windowed apps running and the Deskbar gets very tall...\n\nIf it\u0027s decided to stay with the status quo, I\u0027ll ammend the user guide.",

      "message": "Maybe take some inspiration from how Windows 7 does it.\n\nIn Windows 7, clicking the taskbar entry always activates the corresponding window. There are other actions in a menu, but you don\u0027t need to click anything to see the menu: it just opens whenever the mouse is hovering the taskbar entry.\n\nThen, we get the best of both worlds:\n\n- Activating the window is just one click\n- Accessing the menu is still easy, in fact it is easier than before, with one less click\n- Actions can be consistent: single click on an app can always bring it to front, and the windows are accessible in a menu that pops up automatically\n\nIs this a good idea? Would the menu get in the way in some cases? I don\u0027t know, but it seems like something worth experimenting with.\n\nWe can play with a few variants of this. For example, in \"expando\" mode, we could expand the app that\u0027s under the cursor, and fold all others (with a nice animation as things expand and contract, somewhat similar to Mac OS X dock?). In non-expando modes it would be a popup menu outside deskbar instead.\n\nAm I going too crazy with this?",

      "message": "Windows\u0027s \"hover to get the menu\" is sometimes annoying. I also like how the Deskbar menus are just menus with some extra features, not a different paradigm. But let\u0027s see what others think.\n\nYour \"expando\" ideas sound interesting, but I basically never use expando-mode, so I don\u0027t really have an opinion about that.",
