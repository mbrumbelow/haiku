      "message": "The flat decorator was included about a year ago, I\u0027d think a decorator going in the other direction has about the same justification.\n\nAs for intree vs out of tree, currently it\u0027s more difficult out of tree since the decorator api may change, and building this outside the tree is more difficult. (Here it\u0027s fairly straughtforward, not sure how I\u0027d even build it standalone)\n\nanyhow, I\u0027ve uploaded it here to get some feedback on whether this has any merit for haiku itself, and on the code. I\u0027ll likely develop it myself anyway, but atleast for some elements of HaikuControllook like rounded cor ers and knobs there has been somw contention, I\u0027d assume that having a controllook that goes nore in the skemorphism side of things would make HaikuControllool less contentious as the default middle ground so to speak.",

But I think some people didn\u0027t agree and we ended up putting it in haiku_extras as a compromise.\n\nAnyway, since I\u0027m in the camp of \"perfectly happy with the default look\" I am not very interested in this :)",
