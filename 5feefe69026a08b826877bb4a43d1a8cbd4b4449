      "message": "Yes: the precise type of \"int32\" changes with architecture and pointer bit depth. There are differences even on 32-bit x86 between gcc2 and gcc8+ for BeOS ABI reasons. Sometimes int32 is just an int (%d), sometimes it\u0027s a long int (%ld), and when it\u0027s one and not the other, we\u0027ll get compiler warnings and maybe errors. That\u0027s the entire reason for the use of the PRI macros rather than just writing %ld or %d in the first place.",
