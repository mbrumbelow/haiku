      "message": "Already looks better!\n\nOne problem remaining seems to be that three text lines render below everything else, with a \"^\" symbol, I assume this is supposed to be under some node and not below the diagramm itself?\n\nNevermind, Now i understand what those are supposed to be... Notes, Sorry. I misunderstood this part.\n\nPerhaps to make this clearer we can use superscript anotations intead?\ni.E instead of \"^^ PCI Host Controller\" use \"PCI Host Controller¹\"\n\nAnd then have the note start wth the ¹ as in \"¹ PCI Host controller may be a child of ACPI root if the detectionmechanism is ACPI instead of Legacy BIOS. Take a look at \"busses/pci\" for more details.\"\n\nChars: ¹ ² ³\n\nI would assume that svg also has some \"Native\" way to write supersciprt numbers normally.
