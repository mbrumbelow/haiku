      "message": "The PCI RNG device is of class 0 and of subclass 0xff. This makes it non-generic, and isn\u0027t handled by any PCI cases, thus why I added the virtio path.\n\nI don\u0027t know what your non-pci devices are exactly, but the fact you need to add this path on the generic case indicates that the device node doesn\u0027t have the attributes B_DEVICE_TYPE and B_DEVICE_SUB_TYPE. That\u0027s OK.\n\nAbout virtio_mmio sets B_DEVICE_BUS to \"virtio\", well, I prefer the virtio_pci classic design, which uses the virtio bus manager, and I\u0027m not supporting other designs.",
