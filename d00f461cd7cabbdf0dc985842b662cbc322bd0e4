      "message": "With the recent changes to how desktop text color is handled,\nI wouldn\u0027t be surprised if these were edge cases that testing missed. :)\n\nIn terms of the \"SetShowHideSelection()\" function, I can\u0027t be too sure over it\u0027s original purpose, as it predates OpenTracker\u0027s initial import into the Haiku source tree. However, a quick search in the source code shows that it only controlled drawing-related behavior (which had since been broken).",

      "message": "It looks like a leftover from an old Tracker setting that allowed to not show the selection at all when the window is inactive.\n\nSince we already show it greyed out in that case, I think the setting is unneeded and the code related to it can be completely removed. It looks like it will simplify quite a lot of things in this area, and it is not reachable from our current Tracker settings window anyways.",
