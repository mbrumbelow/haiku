To turn on this feature, you have to subclass BListView and implement InitiateDrag() to return true.\"\n\nRelevant to the crash\n\nhttps://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/bebook/BView.html#BView_GetMouse\n\n\"You shouldn\u0027t use this function to track the mouse; implement the MouseMoved() function instead.\"\n\nWhich is essentially telling you that if you want to do this correctly you have to override BListView::MouseMoved().",
