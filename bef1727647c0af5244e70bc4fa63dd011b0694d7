      "message": "The FPU initialization code should probably be in some other place, not here in the common (platform-independent) boot_arch_cpu_init for ARM.\n\nFor the EFI loader, we initialize the FPU before jumping to the kernel entry.S seems to be a better choice.\n\nFor the u-boot based bootloader I\u0027m not quite sure, it could be either in u-boot specific bootloader start code or before jumping to the kernel. If we want to keep the u-boot loader at all.",
