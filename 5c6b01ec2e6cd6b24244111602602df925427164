      "message": "There is a problem with the way we retrieve block number from address and also the block offset. The issue was seen when we had multi-level node (Note: not multi level tree). We don\u0027t get what is expected. I don\u0027t have an explanation for why it worked till when the nodes were of 1 level. We have to look into this.",

Or it has been fixed.(I remember that someone told me it was fixed, but I am not sure if it refers to this one.)\nIf it is not, please show/told me the details.\nIf it is, I guess I will:\n- compared it with #3124, which was merged latest, and saved which version we need(I got merge confict when I git cherry-pick this one over the latest version)   \n- fix the coding style problems(\u0027too long\u0027 mostly), since I thought there was no more functions added in this patch",
