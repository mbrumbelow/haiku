      "message": "So, we now have virtio_pci for PCI, and virtio_mmio for FDT and ACPI.\n\nIs that the right architecture?\n\nWe could have virtio_pci, virtio_fdt and virtio_acpi.\n\nOr we could have a single virtio driver with if/else (as done here) in places where we need to do things differently depending on the bus used. I think PCI is different in exactly the same places? Once the setup is done it is memory mapped an it works the same way, right?\n\nI don\u0027t know what the correct solution is, but I find it a bit strange that virtio_pci is separate, while FDT and ACPI are in the same file?",
