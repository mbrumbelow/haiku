This code mounts the first partition unless you specify the -all parameter at command line and then it will mount all partitions. This works for anyboot images where the first partition is the most relevant one, but in other cases this would  mount the small boot partition instead of the large data partition you were looking for.

      "message": "It can be done in the other direction. Multi-partition disk images would be handled by the diskimage tool, not by mountvolume.\n\nCurrently, that tool only registers the image (using the \"diskimage register\" command) and then you still need to mount it (unless you have Tracker set to mount everything)\n\nWe can extend diskimage to additionally force Tracker to mount the newly registered partitions. For example there could be a \"diskimage mount\" command that does this in addition to what \"diskimage register\" already does. This new command would optionally allow to specify a partition number, or, by default, mount the first partition found.\n\nI don\u0027t know if that\u0027s better. From a user perspective, the existence of the two tools (diskimage and mountvolume) is a bit confusing, and it\u0027s unclear when to use one or the other. And from the developer point of view, whichever way we go, one of the tools will have to implement the job of the other anyway.  So, maybe we should merge these into a single tool?",
