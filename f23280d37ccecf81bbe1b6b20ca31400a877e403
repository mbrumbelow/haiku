      "message": "I think the original implementation is already wrong. We shouldn\u0027t pass tints around to try and \"fix\" the base color.\nIf the intent is to use black or white it should pass kBlack or kWhite as base color, and no tint.\n\nAdditionally the constructor for DrawScrollBarButton should take a second rgb_color so the caller in interface kit can properly pass the high color so this can be used instead. (For example if we decide later we want to draw this with an accent color)",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure if we need ABI compatibility with the current controlLook, this is \"only\" used internally. And controllooks can be recompiled if this is a problem.\n\nIn this case I think the api as it was is just wrong, and keeping compat doesn\u0027t make much sense, but you could probably introduce a second variant if you want. But that would make using older controlLooks not work on newer Haikus. So not sure this is better.",
