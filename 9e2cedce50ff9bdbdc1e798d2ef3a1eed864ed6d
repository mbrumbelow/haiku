      "message": "This would also show you previously generated thumbnails even when you turn the setting off which is not the intent of the code. But I suppose it would allow you to see thumbnails not generated by Tracker even when the setting was off. It doesn\u0027t seem like a bad idea to me but it is a change.",

That\u0027s the point of this change: allow the code to go through the icon cache and allow the icon cache to derive info from the node instead of only getting it from the MIME type",
