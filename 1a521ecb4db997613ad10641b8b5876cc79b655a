Some of the functions in here declared as \"Since BeOS R5\" are actually older than that, e.g. check the BShelf git blame: https://github.com/waddlesplash/BeOS-headers/blob/R5/headers/be/interface/Shelf.h\n\nSince everything \u003c R3 was a preview version, I think we can just say \"Since BeOS R3\" if it\u0027s at least that old. I think this is what our documentation already does.",
