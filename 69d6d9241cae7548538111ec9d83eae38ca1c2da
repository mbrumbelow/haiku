      "message": "There is an additional change (accidentally put in the next commit, I have to move it): pci_ram_address needs to be a no-op since the addresses don\u0027t need to be converted.\n\nI see no reason to use a runtime flag to say \"this CPU has a dedicated I/O space\", that is not at all a thing that needs to change at runtime, and so an ifdef is the right solution.\n\nWe can move the affected code out of this file to use Jamfiles instead of #ifdef (have something like pci_mmio.cpp?), but I don\u0027t think it makes things much simpler. I can try it.",
