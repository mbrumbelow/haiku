      "message": "I actually think we should not have this particular convenience function.\n\nThe rationale would be that the Wait function cannot just unlock-wait-lock, it has to unlock-enable interrupts-wait-disable interrupts-lock. That is, a quick scan of code that used this Wait function could easily miss the fact that calling it implicitly re-enables interrupts.\n\nThat may not be a problem in some contexts, but it could pose one in others. For that reason I believe the interrupts switch and then wait should not be hidden inside a Wait().",
