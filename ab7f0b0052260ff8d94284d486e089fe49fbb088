      "message": "NP. The Debugger code is quite complex, and I\u0027m hoping to simplify it little by little.\n\nCurrently, WaitForThreadOrUser, contrary to its name, only waits for a thread to stop for debugging. It then returns. The first half of WaitForThreadOrUser\u0027s code was dedicated to figuring out if a thread was stopped. I made ProcessPendingEvents keep track of the stopped thread instead. This gets rid of the majority of the code in WaitForThreadOrUser. Afterwards, I rearranged some of the internals of the function.",
