      "message": "Casting from font_family to const char ** produces only garbage (tried with some printf magic), which leads to if (!markedItem) always returning and stopping further execution of the code. Changing the variable to const char * and casting to char* later for get_font_style works better, allowing you to directly select a font family without also selecting a specific style, and fixes font cycling when only the family is selected.",
