The only thing it seems to need to know is information like whether we are in Trash or not, and that can be easily passed in. That would save a lot of code, and reduce the church this patch adds.",

      "message": "But *why*? What about this method is actually specific to the FilePanel? It only handles some shortcuts and not others but so what?\n\nswitch() is cheap (very cheap, usually, as it gets compiled to something like a \"jump table\".) Having one big switch() with all possible menu items in it will be very fast, it doesn\u0027t make sense to break things out into specialized update methods just to have smaller switch()es.",
