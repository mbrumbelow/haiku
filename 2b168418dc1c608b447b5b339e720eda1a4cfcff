      "message": "Could show different brightness of colour to reflect the CPU activity.  tint_color() can be used to generate the different brightnesses.  Maybe limit it to a few colours, which you kind of do right now (to two colours).  Perhaps 4 is better: black, dark gray, light gray, white.  Or make it a constant in the code, N colours.  Or maybe what you have is enough detail.  Hmmm, could you also show CPU core temperatures the same way?",
