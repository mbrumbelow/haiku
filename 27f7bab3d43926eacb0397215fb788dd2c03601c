      "message": "Yes, that was the idea: to use the OPTION key mainly for window management and Stack\u0026Tile. There are (or rather, were) two reasons for this:\n\n- Avoid Stack\u0026Tile and other OS global shortcuts with the command key, to be sure the command key is available (with any combination) for applications. If we later add more system shortcuts, it will then not break shortcuts for existing apps.\n- Some (old) keyboards don\u0027t have an OPTION key, so it is a good idea that apps don\u0027t rely on this key to exist.\n\nHowever, the shortcuts in BTextView are also system shortcuts. So, even if we go with that usage, it is OK to reallocate the shortcuts to BTextView.\n\nThe question is: does anyone use these Stack\u0026Tile shortcuts? All of them seem to be duplicate of other shortcuts (with page up, page down or tab). It\u0027s not great to use two shortcuts for the same thing. Let\u0027s keep just one.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t necessarily agree that there should be exactly one shortcut key for these actions, but the arrow keys are problematic and always have been. We could implement an alternate for example we could use Option+Number keys to go to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. tab. I\u0027m pretty sure that won\u0027t conflict. Yes PgUp and PgDn are not on all keyboards, and maybe we could pick a better shortcut key here, but it doesn\u0027t conflict afaik so it\u0027s ok for now.",
