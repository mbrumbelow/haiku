      "message": "It seems like the behaviour in Linux never results in EINVAL (probably why I didn\u0027t see in a different man page). If it\u0027s less than 0, then it acts like pthread_tryjoin_np, returning ETIMEDOUT, else it blocks like regular pthread_join from my tests. If that sounds like a satisfactory implementation, I can do that.",

      "message": "It should be EINVAL in the case where tv_nsec is larger than 1000000000 nanoseconds (1 second). That\u0027s a malformed timespec structure and isn\u0027t allowed.\n\nIt should be ETIMEDOUT if the time passed in is in the past (but wait_for_thread_etc will take care of that, I think?).\n\nI\u0027m not sure what should happen if abstime is NULL (but wait is true), shouldn\u0027t that behave the same as the non-timeout version? In that case I think the \u0027bool wait\u0027 parameter should not be needed (there is a timeout if abstime !\u003d NULL, and there isn\u0027t if abstime \u003d\u003d NULL). Thqt\u0027s not documented in the manpages, but it is what I would expect by analogy with other \"timed\" methods (for example Linux syscalls ppoll, pselect, epoll_pwait2 behave this way).",
