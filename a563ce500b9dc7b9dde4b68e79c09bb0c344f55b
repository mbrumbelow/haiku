      "message": "Fixes several old and new bugs:\n\n* Open with... window gets tool tip text color not document color\n  after drag.\n* Force Edit name select box background color to be black/or white\n  depending on the inverse of your background color on Desktop\n  instead of using document colors.\n* Determine if volume is read-only by pose instead of its parent,\n  this fixes a bug where read-only volumes mounted on a read-write\n  directory like the Desktop had an editable name even though they\n  were not supposed to. It wouldn\u0027t let you change the name though.",
