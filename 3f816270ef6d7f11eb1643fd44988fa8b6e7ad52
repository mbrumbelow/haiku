      "message": "I think you are changing how this works now with the `return 0`. To make this work like before but take into account `B_NO_COMMAND_KEY` you really just need the `if` for that and then outside the `if` it can still `return (modifiers \u0026 AllowedModifiers()) | B_COMMAND_KEY;` I don\u0027t think Gerrit does suggestions like GitHub as otherwise I would do that here ðŸ˜Š",

      "message": "Oh no. My intention with this is that if you specify any modifiers like Shift or Control youâ€™ll get Command tacked on above. If not and thereâ€™s no B_NO_COMMAND_KEY it means this Shortcut has no modifiers and so we pass through the 0. Thatâ€™s the intent at least. Uh, it seems to work but maybe there is a case where this doesnâ€™t work, where you specified no modifiers but want Command tacked on?\n\nThereâ€™s definitely a case here where I want to pass 0 back because there are no modifiers on a Shortcut, and it wasnâ€™t working right unless I made this change, it was activating shortcuts with just Caps Lock turned on for bare Shortcuts, and we definitely donâ€™t want that. But maybe I could do this a little differently.",
