      "message": "this is the normal behavior with the default drawing mode. To draw on a transparent bitmap correctly you need to use B_OP_ALPHA with the correct blending mode.\n\nThis isn\u0027t visible in BeOS with a simple line drawing because BeOS doesn\u0027t do antialiasing by default. But if you try to draw something transparent you get the same result.",

      "message": "\u003e did this end up being needed for WebKit, or did you find another solution eventually?\n\nThere was a [commit](https://github.com/haiku/haikuwebkit/pull/45/commits/38cc8bc274982ac5c2143587c1a74b348a255f84) that made WebKit use `B_BITMAP_ACCEPTS_VIEWS` less often, which happened to result in the problem being solved. Obviously, simply using `B_BITMAP_ACCEPTS_VIEWS` is somewhat brittle. If, say, the UIProcess decides to do some post-processing to the image, then I expect it to break.\n\n\u003e In any case, I\u0027m not sure why it was done this way. Maybe we should look at the Git history to see what this was attempting to fix.\n\nHere\u0027s the commit that introduced it: https://git.haiku-os.org/haiku/commit/?id\u003d95baf31294ee9c7fb9e2cf768422c10a2a74a42a. Not very helpful, is it? :P",
