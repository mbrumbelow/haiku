      "message": "However, here we are adding more than 5 characters (especially if i gets large). Rather than cutting the string and just losing the last characters as snprintf does, it may be a better choice to instead remove more characters from the baseName in the first sprintf, so we are sure there is enough space left in the regionName here to fit everything.",
