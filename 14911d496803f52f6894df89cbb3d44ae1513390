(see https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/19584#comment:1)\n\nRealized the whole build tool was used so our build system provided an unzip binary. (which exists on every host system, and our docs require the host to install unzip anyway)\n\nInstead of relying on antique code, lets just use the host tools and do away with it.\n\nNo consumers of libzip in code, and we already have an unzip port in our image.",

      "message": "All of our changes to unzip have been upstreamed a few years ago.\n\nBut, yes, this very much needs xattrs to work with the xattr compatibility layer, for example to extract WebPositiveBookmarks.zip correctly into the image (with the icon and URL for each bookmark).\n\nI think the host unzip will not be able to do that correctly.\n\nDo we use unzip for anything else? If not, I would be very happy to replace WebPositiveBookmarks with some jam rules and rdef files.",
