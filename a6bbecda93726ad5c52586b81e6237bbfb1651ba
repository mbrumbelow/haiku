      "message": "I don\u0027t think POSIX AIO is very popular. Most things which implement it do so on top of some internal API. Likely we should add a more flexible internal API (with fewer syscalls, while we\u0027re at it) to implement POSIX AIO on top of, if we do it at all.",

      "message": "AIO is terribly implemented in Linux, but it work great in BSD/Solaris. It can be gracefully integrated to various 3rd party IO libraries and give speed up.\n\nIt should naturally integrate with IORequest and be easy to implement on Haiku. I plan to allow using Haiku ports (port_id) to receive IO completion notifications.\n\nI agree that number of syscalls can be reduced, I planned to do that after getting initially functional implementation.",
