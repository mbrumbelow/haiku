Outbound network traffic from Haiku onto tun/0 seems to be disappearing.  Of note is zero tcpdump ICMP messages seen on Haiku.  Essentially the outbound ARP requests looking up the mac address are failing to be replied to.  OSI layer 2\n \n\nAs this is a 1:1 behavior, and this implementation is much simpler, i\u0027m changing this to a +2.  It represents no regression, and will be easier to debug.",
