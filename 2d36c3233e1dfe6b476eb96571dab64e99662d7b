It should also point the internal pkgman repo database to it as well on images.\n\nI didn\u0027t bother updating haikuports.  *technically* we could change the URL to r1beta4 + symlink it.. and leave the identifier as \"master\", but that feels like overkill for now as long as our \"forking haikuports\" ambitions are low this release.",
