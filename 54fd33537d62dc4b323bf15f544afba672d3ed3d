      "message": "I have a problem with this. Windows aren\u0027t aware of stacks, and while one would argue that changes like \"window minimized\", \"window maximized\", etc., the BWindow class does have functions for when a window is resized, for example.\n\nWould it best to just modify the behavior of the new window button, or would it be more beneficial for Haiku to either introduce a BMessage that would be sent to a window as it gets stacked/unstacked, just as an FYI for the application? :)\n\nI\u0027m slightly afraid that if I am to implement something like this straight into the application itself, then other app developers that wish to take a similar approach (which we are not only establishing as possible, but also *validating* by using it on our own) will have to reuse code or come up with janky hacks.",
