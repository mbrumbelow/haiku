      "message": "I\u0027m with PulkoMandy here. I don\u0027t think those \"Contribute device IDs\" menu entries are really necessary (and the USB on doesn\u0027t seems to do anything for me).\n\nOther than that, not bad having a more streamlined interface!\n\nBut with the detailed info being the only view, I would like to see, if possible, some standard ordering on some of the common fields. E.g: something like:\n\nManufacturer\nClass Info\nDevice name\nDevice path\nDriver used\n\u003cbus/device dependent fields here\u003e\n\nAnd instead of some alphabetical field name sorting... something that \"makes more sense\", like device/vendor and device/id being placed one after the other, for example.\n\nHope I\u0027m making sense myself :-)",

      "message": "(1) These are common resources that only evolve through contributions from the open source community. As this is also what provides the device vendor/product IDs for more human friendly naming (hehe), and given the already \"technical\" angle of the Devices application, I think it makes sense to have them here - or at least until the older greyed out items are finally implemented, perhaps.\n\n(2) Yes, I kind of agree with you on the ordering of attributes, as there indeed is something of a logical order in which you\u0027d normally put them. However, it was previously listed in alphabetical order, so I didn\u0027t want to touch it at this point (also because the different device types might require different orders of attribute perhaps; I haven\u0027t given any thought to it yet).",
