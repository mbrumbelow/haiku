      "message": "What is a PCI floppy disk? Floppy drives died when the usb sticks arrived, there are some usb-based floppy drives though. Floppy drives had a whopping performance of 30KB/s and could store up to 1.4 MB. There is no reason to have it anymore, it is just outdated. The code isn\u0027t working either. Postponing cleanups is creating a bigger tech debt and bigger PR\u0027s for later, so why would we do that?",
