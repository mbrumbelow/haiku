If we decide that it is wrong, we change it, no matter who wrote it and when.\n\nBut we do not change things simply because \"that was then, this is now\", nor do we refuse to change for the same reason either. Haiku has been accused of being \"stuck in the past\", yes, but if those accusations come because we simply refuse to change our UI design and desktop layout every 5 years like Linux desktops seem to do, or we refuse to add useless (or worse, confusing) features and simply \"leave things as they are,\" that\u0027s entirely fine by me. In fact, it\u0027s a sign of a maturity to be able to say, \"this is good as it is, it does not need to be changed\"!\n\nYou, and many other people, may well be used to how things are done on Linux (or Windows, or ...). Well, we are not Linux, and if you come here expecting that things are done \"like Linux, but just a bit differently\", you will be mistaken and probably frustrated. True, we do provide various facilities to allow users coming from other OSes to adapt more quickly (Alt/Ctrl swapping being one example), but just like macOS does not cater to Windows users in their design choices, neither do we cater to Linux users. We have our own habits, our own patterns of thought, and while we are certainly influenced by the good ideas of other systems, we don\u0027t adopt them \"just because.\"",

There must be a way to submit bigger changes or things will never evolve. This is even more true with regards to the non-core application stuff (hey, how long has my simple Devices streamlining push been hanging now by the way?). And I do know for a fact that I am not at all alone in this opinion. Plus, I don\u0027t think you\u0027d prefer forked apps on HaikuDepot or GitHub, but that too is an option of course. Or developers will eventually lose interest and leave.\n\nThis said: I *did* ask you some time ago where such discussions best take place, but I never received an answer.

While most certainly not perfect, I\u0027d still say this commit is a decent upgrade compared to the old version - also fixing some user visible bugs and shortcomings - which is the key metric as I see it. And I am sure there will be versions to follow; Rome was not built in a day as the saying goes. This is open source; we evolve through iterative developments. My 20 cents.
