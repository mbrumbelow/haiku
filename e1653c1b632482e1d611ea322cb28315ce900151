I just spent half an hour reviewing your changes, and explaining why they should be removed because they make the app worse.\n\nThis is very time consuming and counter productive. If your patches continues to be in this way, I will simply stop reviewing them because it is faster for me to just fix bugs myself (when there are actual bugs).",
