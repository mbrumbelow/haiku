      "message": "Well, you do of course also have the option *not* to review some commits yourself, instead letting someone else (or no one else for that matter) do it. There must be a way to submit bigger changes or things will never evolve. This is even more true with regards to the non-core application stuff (hey, how long has my simple Devices streamlining push been hanging now by the way?). And I do know for a fact that I am not at all alone in this opinion. Plus, I don\u0027t think you\u0027d prefer forked apps on HaikuDepot or GitHub, but that too is an option of course. Or developers will eventually lose interest and leave.\n\nThis said: I *did* ask you some time ago where such discussions best take place, but I never received an answer. Would it be on IRC (few there simultaneously?), the dev mailing list (seems very dormant?), or perhaps over a beer somewhere in France? Please clarify.\n\nLast but not least, some friendly reviewing feedback: You did not mention at *all* any positive aspects (I\u0027d like to think there were some) of this commit, only (arguably minor in comparison) more subjective things. While most certainly not perfect, I\u0027d still say this commit is a decent upgrade compared to the old version - also fixing some user visible bugs and shortcomings - which is the key metric as I see it. And I am sure there will be versions to follow; Rome was not built in a day as the saying goes. This is open source; we evolve through iterative developments. My 20 cents. Let me know if you still disagree.",
