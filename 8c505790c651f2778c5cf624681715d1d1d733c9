      "message": "Ok! This patch as it stands:\n\n* x86/qemu efi:  Serial output FIXED from master\n* riscv64/qemu efi: Serial output working\n* riscv64/visionfive efi: Serial output fixed from master\n\nI noticed that r1beta4 doesn\u0027t actually have serial output when booted from EFI.  This actually improves x86 serial and improves non-x86 serial as well. ðŸŽ‰\n\nYou might notice that the hacky COM1 stuff in efi/serial.cpp is commented out.  It wasn\u0027t working in r1beta4, and is actively breaking boot when enabled.\n\nI think there might be some room to investigate making it work as a fallback, however this marks a big improvement.\n\n10th time the charm",
