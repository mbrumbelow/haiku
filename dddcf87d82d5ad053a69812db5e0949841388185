      "message": "Maybe nitpicking, as in the common case it will work, but the braces are not only unnecessary, but wrong. `if` tests an exit status, `test` checks something depending on its arguments. Be that with `which` or with `command`, with or without a subshell, you feed `test` what those output. If what you are looking for is an alias, you give it \"alias\" as first argument and something like \"xorriso\u003d\u0027xorriso -x\u0027\" as second, `test` doesn\u0027t understand it, returns an error and the `else` path is taken. Likewise if the command is in a path with spaces.",
