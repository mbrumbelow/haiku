Those crashes were made more frequent by allowing modifiers without command key since it calls MenusBeginning() in more cases. \n\nIn #19386 it says \"This was always a bit of a buggy feature as the context menus often didn\u0027t appear when you initially started browsing files. Clicking on the menubar would make them appear.\"",
