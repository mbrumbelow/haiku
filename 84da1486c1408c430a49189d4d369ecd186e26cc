      "message": "I must not have made myself clear. Vulcan death grip is a keyboard shortcut, this simply makes the shortcut also work in mini-mode as #17761 asks for. Two other shortcuts were brought with it: shift+middle-click launches a new instance of the team and ctrl+click/ctrl+shift+click to show all/hide all. Another bug this fixes (not explicitly stated in the commit message) is restoring shift+middle-click on a window item closes it in expando mode which was inadvertently disabled.",
