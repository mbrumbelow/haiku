      "message": "I would call HSV a color model, that would make more sense to me.\n\nThere can\u0027t be a negative contrast, a contrast has no direction. It is the difference in lightness between two colors\n\nThe contrast between Black and White is 255\nDoesn\u0027t equate to it beeing -255 for White and Black\n\nSo 0 on one end is the same and 255 is the maximum ammount of contrast.\n\nThis is just a theoretical thing but it is also what makes sense intuitivly for contrast, it\u0027s always a positive number.\n\nIf we add negative numbers here people may write code like\n\nIf foreground.Contrast(background) \u003e 20 then\n  use colors as is\nelse\n  fall back to other colors\nend\n\nonly to discover the code only works in light mode and in dark mode it breaks down.\n\n\u003e Still, changing this so that it makes clear the function does not just give the contrast of one color (whatever that would mean), but returns the contrast of that color against this color, may make sense.\n\nWhy? The \"whatever that would mean\" already makes it clear. There can\u0027t be a contrast for just one color, it is a property that only arrises when considering severall colors. :)",
