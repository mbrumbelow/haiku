      "message": "I think this is a good change, but we should do it without using pre-processor.\n\nI recommend to have \"\"arch-init()\"\" functions and have each arch implement them if needed.\nFinding and working with #if\u0027s gets really hard if you do it all over the OS code base. Arch specific sources and managing it in build-system seems to work better and something we already do in many places.\n\nI\u0027m okay with merging this, but I would prefer to have an additional PR submitted to go arch-dir approach. So setting -1 for us to discuss it a bit more. ",
