The mail kit is also losing support for gmail because we need to support OAuth2 which is going to need things like built-in base64 encoding.\n\nForm a naming standpoint:\n\n* libcrypto is taken\n* libCryptoKit was suggested matching \"R2 library names\", but needs more discussion\n* Open to other names?\n\nWhatever we call it... it should reflect anything \"cryptography related\" to keep our options open in what we can pack into it.",
