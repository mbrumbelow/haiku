      "message": "Few points I\u0027m thinking of:\n\n1. After minimizing or restoring a window, I found that snoozing for a few ms helps keeping the correct window order. I\u0027m just assuming that when you call do_window_action spawns a new thread and so if one thread finishes before the previous the window order gets messed up. Is there a better way to do this? Is obviously annoying to take a peek at the desktop only to find, after restoring, that you don\u0027t have the window you were using on front.\n\n2. About Deskbar detection: is this strictly mandatory? The Deskbar window obviously doesn\u0027t respond to the minimize order and so after \"minimizing all\" you still have a window \"open\", which mess up my detection method to know if we should minimize or restore. My first approach was to check if there was 1 open window instead of 0, but... is there a cheaper way to check if a window belongs to Deskbar than mine?\n\n3. Thanks for your patience. Suggestions and changes are most welcome.",
