I don\u0027t think it makes very clear that this setting circumvents the Trash. \"Disable Trash, delete immediately\" would be totally clear, but a bit more wordy.\n\nDoes the \"Confirm deletion\" setting mean you get an alert when emptying the trash, or when trashing (or deleting) a file that got removed by pressing DEL?",
