      "message": "Well, don\u0027t. That is not how RISC-V is designed. M-mode is for firmware. S-mode is for operating systems, including operating system boot loaders. BBL, OpenSBI or U-Boot SPL should be the only thing that touches M-mode. M-mode is the equivalent of EL3 on Arm and the various SMM etc modes of X86, not ring 0.",

      "message": "So use OpenSBI; QEMU even ships with pre-built blobs. It boots instantly and follows the exact same boot API as bare metal (a0 and a1 are the hart ID and DTB), except your kernel starts in S-mode with the hardware pre-programmed for you. And this works on real hardware too if you have an appropriate OpenSBI build (which U-Boot bundles in its SPL, and runs before jumping to the full U-Boot implementation).\n\nAnd writing your own for fun, fine, but that doesn\u0027t belong in an upstream OS, it adds code complexity that results in maintenance burden for something that shouldn\u0027t exist.",
