      "message": "After a lot of time spent, I think that the memory management just needs work. I don\u0027t think the styles ever get freed because they never reach a ref count of 0. I think this might be due to the FontCache, which doesn\u0027t get cleared of user fonts (and probably should).\n\nSo, I put the destructors back pretty much to the way they were before this review (even though they are incorrect) and made this review about cleanup and autolocking. I will work on the destruction in a separate code review.",
