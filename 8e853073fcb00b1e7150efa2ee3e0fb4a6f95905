      "message": "I\u0027m not sure what do you mean with \"the -- part\". If you\u0027re talking about line 563, I had to change that because erase() doesn\u0027t return anything in C99, so the previous patchset was failing to build on gcc2. erase() uses the \"old\" iterator value and just then increments it, so this is specifically this way not to miss interfaces (that indeed would be the case if I had used ++it).\n\nOn the other case it really doesn\u0027t matter since the value of it it\u0027s not used in that expression. I can change this to it++ as well if you think it makes more sense for both to be the same way.\n\nAgreed on the comments part, this is just me overcommenting and not knowing the style conventions used. Will send a new patchset, but first I want to know if there\u0027s a change needed on the other part.",
