      "message": "Hmm, maybe.\n\nPerhaps we should make adjustments to Deskbar and/or BApplication to show background applications in the tray anyway when they are displaying a window? Right now there are some other \"background\" apps (debug_server) which can open windows that can easily get \"lost\" if other apps are dragged over top and then the window itself isn\u0027t in Deskbar.",

      "message": "The window is a custom BAlert. I mention this because there are other \"src/bin/\" programs that have the B_BACKGROUND_APP flag set, while also having BAlerts on their own (or other GUI elements like \u0027BFilePanel\u0027s or even \u0027BWindow\u0027s).\n\nExamples: checkitout, ppp_up, screenmode, screen_blanker, setdecor, spybmessage, urlwrapper.\n\nSeems to me like the idea is for apps usually started from script/shell to have this flag set. I might be completely wrong, of course.",
