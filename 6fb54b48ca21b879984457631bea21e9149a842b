      "message": "Sounds like a good plan :-)\n@x512: in theory you\u0027re correct, but of course relying on the bios is something that the driver will do less and less (eDP on Sandy/Ivy for instance or already programmed more than stricktly needed.)\n\nHopefully turning on power like this will enable register access: that\u0027s missing on some laptops. (On the nVidia driver this is all done internally already btw, but ok, that\u0027s an older driver ;-)",
