      "message": "\u003e In a more general sense I don\u0027t think we should do this at all\n\nI\u0027m genuinely perplexed to hear this feedback at this stage, after laying out an idea/proposal and expecting it\u0027d be fine after being told that I should just implement this -- which happened after I was hesitant to introduce all of these changes at once so that they don\u0027t get vetoed after many hours of work.\n\n\u003e The text is confusing, for one there is *always* atleast one befs partition, unless you netbooted\n\nNoting that the logic/\"when the text shows up\" is correct. I can add a keyword such as \"available\" or \"target\" in order to make this explicit. Is that an OK approach to you?\n\n\u003e In a more general sense I don\u0027t think we should do this at all but rather add the full disk installation mode, set up partitions should be the advanced case, not the normal one.\n\nI fail to understand the correlation here. That feature doesn\u0027t exist yet and this approach shouldn\u0027t really complement or obstruct a potential implementation of such a feature in any way. If we are to assume that a purely hypothetical easier installation mode is going to be introduced later, why should we not introduce improvements for what we have right now (and what is going to potentially be the \"advanced mode\" in the future) and choose to not be transparent towards the user instead? It can always be adjusted at a later stage, when we actually have something that would make the text outdated.\n\nIf we have a \"guided mode\" or a \"use the entire disk mode\" (in the style of e.g. Debian), it\u0027s likely to take place before the window I am currently modifying appears, so the text will just never be shown to begin with. If that isn\u0027t the case, we can just add an extra \"click on this button instead\" text instead. However, this isn\u0027t relevant now, because this feature does not exist.\n\n\u003e the paragraph also does not account for distro branding.\n\nValid concern. Sorry, I kept pushing updates and forgot about this. I\u0027ll push a new patch set that addresses this using a similar method that I used for FirstBootPrompt.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure where I said that I would agree to any change that was based on the previous one? I said it is difficult to review because I don\u0027t know where you are going with it. In this case I indeed don\u0027t like it that much, it would have been easier to discuss beforehand what you wanted to implement before asking to review details of the implementation.\n\nI don\u0027t have time all the time to review stuff, thus this is a bit later than I\u0027d have liked, but not much I can do about it.\n\nI entirely disagree that the \"full disk\" mode would appear before this window, I\u0027d think it would be exactly here, as simply another option in the combobox.\n\nThe concern isn\u0027t invalid just because the full disk mode isn\u0027t added yet, it\u0027s not *that* difficult to do, it just isn\u0027t done yet. We shouldn\u0027t modify installer in a way that conflicts with it if we already know we want it to go in that direction.\n\nAs for your comment about advanced mode I don\u0027t like this because your label tries to direct \"normal\" users to it. If somebody needs the advanced mode they will already know what set up partitions means, and will choose this despite the option to install onto a fu√∂l disk beeing readily available.",

Feedback like this is how I get many ideas for changes I make to the Haiku project, which is why I may come across as very insistent in some cases. This is one of them, as I strongly believe that a change towards this direction is a change for the better.\n\nI will address the branding and the clarity issue that were brought up. However, I cannot address how to deal with this problem, as there are no alternatives for the users to do anything else in this scenario right now and the feature you brought up does not exist right now -- can\u0027t do that a priori and a correction should probably take less time than the amount of time I took to write this reply -- it doesn\u0027t matter what color the bikeshed is.\n\nP.S. I addressed both alternatives, and, again, I don\u0027t see this as a huge problem either way. If possible/applicable, please send me a link to the bug tracker or the review or some sort of place where this rough consensus as to how this is going to be implemented so that I can leave a note about this directly.",
