      "message": "The only improvement these PR\u0027s are that they removes config_manager.\n\nbus_type is put in the local sources that use them, and those experienced in those parts can then clean them properly in other PR\u0027s. This change is already bigger than it should be.\n\nWe should not do too much in single PR\u0027s, it is better to do many small improvement PR\u0027s than asking to change more in one PR. It makes people avoid doing PR\u0027s and you can never get someone to review huge PR\u0027s. So just accept improvements if they are sensible, don\u0027t ask for even more.",

That seems reasonably easy to add here.\n\nThis would allow to keep only a single copy of the define, in the media kit (where apparently AudioBufferSizeFor will pick a different size for ISA and PCI soundcards?).
