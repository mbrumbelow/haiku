This change is already bigger than it should be.\n\nWe should not do too much in single PR\u0027s, it is better to do many small improvement PR\u0027s than asking to change more in one PR. It makes people avoid doing PR\u0027s and you can never get someone to review huge PR\u0027s. So just accept improvements if they are sensible, don\u0027t ask for even more.",

      "message": "It\u0027s more that I don\u0027t have a clue about serial or media or how to test them, so I can\u0027t really do much and rather leave that for someone who does. Removing config_manager is a good step on the way on its own and as the saying goes, you eat an elephant one bite at a time.\nHowever if it is that easy, I can delete the function.\n\nIn MediaRoster the only function using it is audioBufferSizeFor(..., busType \u003d B_UNKNOWN_BUS) which just sets a bigger buffer for ISA and PCMCIA, I recommend removing that function or just have it to return the value for PCI for now.\n\nBut that is as far as I can go in those two areas. I just want to get rid of config_manager. We just seem to end up in endless discussions every time we talk about it. It gets added to every port, it gets compiled into every build yet it does nothing.\n\nSo I propose this:\nWe merge this as is.\nI see I need to do a style-fix or two in driver.h. I\u0027ll do that and removing scan_bus, and if we agree on audioBufferSizeFor above that as well. Probably one or two more style-fixes in modified src-files as well. Please check.\n\nIf I can do it in small incremental changes I might have the energy for it..",
