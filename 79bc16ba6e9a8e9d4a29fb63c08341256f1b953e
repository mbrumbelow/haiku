Guess I need to find the BONE headers and see what functions were provided there.\n\nI think we still shouldn\u0027t provide the incompatible _r functions, as applications coming from BSD, etc. may get confused and behave incorrectly with them, even if BONE provided them. We can still leave them in ABI for BONE compatibility.",
