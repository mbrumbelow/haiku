      "message": "lol.  I figured i\u0027d open it to discussion to see what people though.  The reasoning is debugger lets you continue to run the application while debugging an application. (aka, continue)\n\nCalls to debugger can be just manually done by applications, and are open to being incorrect.\n\nCalling debugger() doesn\u0027t guarantee a \"required terminable offense\" within an application (just like you can continue in kdl)",

      "message": "as an example situation which spawned this... our opengl kit / mesa has a debugger() call in a situation which isn\u0027t a crash or other major issue.\n\nAs a user you can press Run in Debugger and use the OpenGL app as usual.\n\nIs that a bug in mesa which needs corrected? yes.   Should users be forced to run Debugger to use any OpenGL applications until that bug is fixed?",

      "message": "If you\u0027re doing so from within the debugger, chances are you know what you\u0027re doing (e.g. you\u0027ve added an extra one by hand while working on some code). Most of the ones we leave in the official tree are in \"you should not be here\" situations, which I don\u0027t think are something we should easily allow an end user to bypass. This just opens up getting less bug reports.",
