      "message": "Concerning your email on the mailing list: I did first add the verb into the format string as you suggested, but then decided against it because in English, the verb doesn\u0027t change with the number, only the noun changes, so I moved the verbs out. I think this is also consistent with other instances of BStringFormat that I looked at.\n\nIf another language does change verbs based on numbers, the translation can move the verb into the format string.",

We have been lazy with the context and just used the source file name, but that is not very helpful to translators and we should try to have a bit more descriptive contexts like this one when possible.",
