I think this is also consistent with other instances of BStringFormat that I looked at.\n\nIf another language does change verbs based on numbers, the translation can move the verb into the format string.",

Though at least at Polyglot, strings are grouped by their \u0027context\u0027, so having contexts with just a single string using it, instead of a comment, is a bit awkward.\n(KapiX said in the past that he could imagine Haiku moving from Pootle to a Polyglot instance in the future, but we\u0027ll see...)\n\nAnyway, I defer to your coding seniority. ðŸ˜Š\nJust tell what we decided on. ðŸ˜Š",
