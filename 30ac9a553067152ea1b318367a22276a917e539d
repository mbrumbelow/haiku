      "message": "Shouldn\u0027t it be label.RemoveLast(\"Decorator\").Trim() instead? Removing the \"Decorator\" will leave trailing whitespace, which the Trim() will then remove, in that case?\n\nAlso, since this is done in several places, maybe consider moving it to a private method? Not too important now, but I\u0027m worried that sometime we will want to localize decorator and control look names, and in that case the mapping could become more complicated.",

      "message": "The order doesn\u0027t matter because RemoveLast takes the Decorator or ControlLook bit off the string and then the trim takes any leading and trailing spaces off but if it makes you feel better I can Trim() second.\n\nA private method would work to reduce repetition, fair enough.",
