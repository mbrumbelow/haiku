      "message": "That seems to be a pretty powerful function. You have structured it nicely, and used helpful variable names and comments, so that one can easily read through it.\n\nIt would be nice if you could cut it down into smaller pieces, though, as it is very long. For instance, getting the source area list could be moved into a separate function, others probably, too. That could also reduce potential (haven\u0027t checked) code duplication, and sometimes also leads to better and more robust code in those separated functions (one is more willing to go the extra mile if that code may be called by someone else, somehow).",
