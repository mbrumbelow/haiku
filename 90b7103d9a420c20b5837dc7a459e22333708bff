      "message": "That would mean a lot of submenu navigation, it will be unconvenient for something as simple as picking a display resolution.\n\nAlso, several of the resolutions (depending on your graphic card) have an unique width, what would you do then?:\n\n- Have one with with a single entry in the submenu (looks stupid)\n- Have a mix of widths-with-submenu and direct-access resolutions in the top level menu (looks strange)\n\nI don\u0027t understand what you mean by \"over the place\", instead of a single column now there\u0027s 3 columns, making the menu more compact and the items easier to reach bacause they are all closer to the mouse pointer. The items are in the same order as before.",
