      "message": "That would mean a lot of submenu navigation, it will be unconvenient for something as simple as picking a display resolution.\n\nAlso, several of the resolutions (depending on your graphic card) have an unique width, what would you do then?:\n\n- Have one with with a single entry in the submenu (looks stupid)\n- Have a mix of widths-with-submenu and direct-access resolutions in the top level menu (looks strange)\n\nI don\u0027t understand what you mean by \"over the place\", instead of a single column now there\u0027s 3 columns, making the menu more compact and the items easier to reach bacause they are all closer to the mouse pointer. The items are in the same order as before.",

But they are sorted by the width firstmost and then it breaks the list over. The reading order for me would be left to right, top to down.
