      "message": "I understand that you don\u0027t understand what I\u0027m trying to accomplish here. I\u0027ve tried my best to explain it but I must have done a bad job. This fits in to the overall Shortcut paradigm I\u0027m trying to accomplish. BTextView shortcuts must use Cmd for line-wise operations. This Web+ change however is optional. It is for internal consistency. For example Ctrl+Tab is used for switcher, the opposite of Windows\u0027s Alt+Tab. If we follow this paradigm to its logical conclusion this is where we end up. The alternative paradigm is to do Shortcuts like the Mac and reuse the same Command/Alt key for everything. That\u0027s also a valid way to go, but I\u0027m leaning towards the Windows with Ctrl and Alt swapped paradigm instead.",

      "message": "\"like windows but ctrl alt swapped\" is a terrible choice, windows is a terribly OS to copy. Ctrl-tab for switcher is a good example, is it a terribly shortcut and causes me hand pain. And the only reason it is used is \"windows doesn\u0027t use this\" It should be cmd-tab , ctrl-tab can stay as an alternative for people who grew acustom to this.\n\nShift-ctrl instead of ctrl would ve great for BTextView to indicate \"on this line\" instead if \"on this word\". I agree we should not habe this conflict in webpositive.",

      "message": "\"\u0027like windows but ctrl alt swapped\u0027 is a terrible choice, Windows is a terribly OS to copy.\"\n\nSays you, but there are reasons that Windows is doing the things it is doing and there are reasons that Haiku should and is mostly consistent with the expectations of Windows users once Ctrl/Alt are swapped despite your prejudice against Windows and Windows users.\n\nPreviously I would have agreed with you and been on your side of this fence in the past because I want Haiku to behave as the Mac does, but in this case, there is discrepancy between the way Mac and Windows works, and Haiku should in my opinion go down the Windows route with Ctrl/Alt swapped over the Mac route of using Cmd everywhere ignoring conflicts way of doing things.\n\nIf we were to go with the Mac route instead, we should change the Switcher shortcut from Ctrl to Alt. But there is some wisdom to the current choice that you are overlooking, and you\u0027re overlooking it in this patch as well. That wisdom has to do with meeting the expectations of Windows users at least half-way while providing a consistent Shortcut paradigm.",

      "message": "I\u0027m sure. Yet, I do not accept an of your arguments.\nYou can\u0027t just claim that evidence exists, or reasons exist, then refuse to state those and then call me prejudiced. I\u0027ve been a mac user for over three months now, I can adjust to these shortcuts. Before I\u0027ve only ever used Windows, then Linux (also FreeBSD but same UX), and now Haiku for years. My point of view comes from someone developing Haiku for years, I\u0027ve been with Haiku since shortly after beta1, and I do not see what I\u0027ve done to get such disrespect in code reviews from you.\n\nI am perfectly happy to discuss arguments on their merit on their own, to listen to your side etc. But I am done with your combatative style of argumentation, dismissing the other sides validity by claiming they are ignorant, don\u0027t know what they talk about, claim are willfully ignoring arguments or evidence you\u0027ve never brought up. etc.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t do to just claim \"there is wisdow\" or \"there are reason\".\n\nThis also extends to the other change where I\u0027ve mostly tried to reason with you to explain to you where the disconnect comes from why all the other developers seem to disagree on your preference, even outlining alternatives only for you to ignore them and even claim they are uneccesary because the other change exists. (Or strawmanning like claiming that I\u0027ve said that it is fundamentally \"right\" to use delete, and not a preference, and then attacking me based on it while i\u0027ve never made such a claim) Which makes no sesnse at all, since nobody even agree to it, if you want to discuss options that atleast shows you are willing to compromise or consider alternate options that would achieve the same end goal: You beeing happy with your system, me beeing happy, and us beeing able to productively contribute to the same system.\n\nLast change you even seemed to argue that 7078 was intentional design, not a bug, and impossible to fix. Yet here you are proposing a change based on the exact same fix.\n\nAnd now arguing in the completely oposite direction, no longer with your \"everything needs to use cmd because BeOS knew everything\" (this quote is of course exagarated) but instead claiming we should copy Windows of all things.... by doing the exact oposite of what windows does.... yeah makes sense.\n\nTL;DR: Please actually discuss changes in reviews instead of trying to strongarm them in.",

      "message": "I apologize if I have offended, this was not my intent. I am also perfectly willing to discuss changes. I explain my reasoning. I didn’t mean any disrespect, just that you clearly are biased against Windows and you clearly have a different point of view. I’m trying to fix all the problems in the best way. Yes I am highly opinionated yes I will push back because I’m trying to make everything work consistently and I have a vision and it seems like everybody is against me when I’m only trying to help. My combative style may be tinged by how my changes tend to be received unfairly, and are either disallowed or reverted even though they are perfectly good changes.\n\nYes I said that #7078 was a design decision and not a bug, but I acknowledge that not everybody feels that way. Please don’t think I am attacking you personally. There is certainly room for disagreement and I won’t necessarily get my way and the system will be made worse as it has already that but that’s ok. I didn’t say it was impossible to fix, just that it was hard to fix, and boy was it ever hard to fix.\n\nWith 7078 fixed it allows us to be a bit more flexible with our shortcuts. Sorry if I’ve come off a bit strong here, it’s only because I’ve been treated so poorly and now I’m a bit defensive. You are not the reason for this, I shouldn’t take it out on you.
