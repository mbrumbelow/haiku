      "message": "I did consider that option at first. But after reading the ticket(https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/18322) and the associated forum discussion, simply adding a sound option specific to PowerStatus (such as one which played when low battery is detected) might not cut it for a few reasons.\n\nFirstly, the current value for low battery is hardcoded at 15%. \nSecondly, while a simple slider for specifying a low battery percentage can be done, users might wish for a sound notification when for occasions other than a low battery state. For example, they could wish to be notified by sound when their computer has been charged to 80% for example.\nThirdly, users might wish to specify more details regarding the sound warning such as how many times it will be repeated once activated.\n\nThus, having an independent alarm setting that users can clearly use for their own diverse purposes might be the most suitable and modular solution in my opinion.\n\nThe additional options for number of rings and interval between rings might definitely be excessive so do let me know your thoughts.",

Highly advanced notification features like these might be better in a third-party application for the few users that want them.\n\nBut let\u0027s see what the other developers have to say.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t use batteries and if I did all I would want is a charge measure, not sounds or even alerts, so my opinion may not be of much value.\n\nI can understand a sound on low battery condition, just as there is a visual notification. I can even accept the possibility of another cue on battery charged condition. And, while I think it shouldn\u0027t be necessary, I also get that the points at which those conditions are met may be user configurable.\n\nWhat I can\u0027t understand is this detachment of alerts from low/full battery conditions. What you are proposing here is that I should be able to set a sound for the moment the battery is charged, say 63%, and that I should be able to do that in PowerStatus. And, if I\u0027m reading it correctly, the audio would be played when passing the threshold in whatever direction. All that while it keeps notifying the low battery condition at 15% and the charge colors keep changing at 15% and 30%.\n\nOn the repetition and intervals, it seems these are of 1 ms to 1 s. I\u0027d say if someone wants 10 beeps separated by half a second they should set a sound that is 10 beeps separated by half a second. The only use I can see for the repetition would be with much longer intervals and with infinite repetitions, as a real alarm, the computer begging for your attention to plug it in before it passes out. I don\u0027t think it\u0027d be wise to keep powering audio under such a condition.",

      "message": "Thanks for your input.\n\nI think I will remove the options for setting number of beeps and interval between beeps as it seems excessive. Instead, one beep (of whatever audio file the user chooses) should suffice.\n\nI think I see two possible options.\n\n\nA. Merge the beeps with low battery condition. This means that if enabled, there will be a beep whenever _NotifyLowBattery is called.\n\nB. Same as A. The only difference being that instead of the condition for low battery being hardcoded (currently at 15%), a slider can be added for the user to determine what exactly is low battery.\n\nBoth options will have an option to enable or disable the beeps via the PowerStatus app and a button which starts Sounds for ease.\n\n\nWhat do you think?",
