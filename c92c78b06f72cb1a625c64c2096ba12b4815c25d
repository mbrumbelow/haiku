      "message": "You seem to store a worker thread id only in this one member fWorkerThread. Maybe another part of the code makes sure that you canâ€™t start another worker while one is already running, but the mechanics here seem too fragile: You would leak the thread data. At least check fWorkerThread at he start of the method before allocating anything.",
