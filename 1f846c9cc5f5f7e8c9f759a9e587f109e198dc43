The check is now limited to the same folder.  \nIf the bookmark already exists, the function now returns silently, if WebPositive creates the file (as in dragging to the bookmark bar or using the \"Bookmark this Page\" menu item).  With drag and drop to Tracker, behavior is governed by Tracker\u0027s policy, which is to create a numbered duplicate file.",
