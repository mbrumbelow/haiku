      "message": "Hello David; I am a bit worried that loading all of the bitmaps of app of the packages into the application\u0027s memory may cause startup delays and also consume quite a bit of memory as the repositories continue to grow.  I think that in general there are HVIF icons available; maybe it is best to not load the PNGs if the HVIF is provided?  Ideally the icons would be loaded into memory as required, but that\u0027s probably a bigger story.  What do you think?",
