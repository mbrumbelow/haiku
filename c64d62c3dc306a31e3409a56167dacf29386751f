But I\u0027m very bad at naming, and I\u0027d rather it was something to do with the meaning of the enum instead of its use in this specific method. I had though of COORDINATE_SPACE before submitting, but that\u0027s too long. CS is too unHaikuy.\n\nWould BASIS be meaningful enough?\n\nAnd now that I\u0027ve noticed that is the correct English name I have to change \"base\" as the method argument.",
