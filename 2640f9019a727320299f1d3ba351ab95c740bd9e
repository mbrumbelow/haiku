      "message": "A welcome improvement!\nIt would be even nicer, if the text below the app icons would be vertically centered WRT the window icon. See https://0x0.st/HN68.png\nIt already much better than the current alignment, though...\n\nThe \"swishy lines\" for a window on another workspace aren\u0027t as obvious as they are with the current bitmap icons. But that\u0027s another patch.",

      "message": "The Twitcher window fits in 640x480 just fine with 48x48 icons. The icon size also increases with font size. I tried to tie the base icon size to the icon size slider but currently Twitcher only supports a single fixed icon size at startup so that didn’t work. If this is undesired that’s fine, I kept the icon size 32x32 in my previous patch for that reason.",
