      "message": "This was worked on in https://review.haiku-os.org/c/haiku/+/8234 already, but SetHighUIColor() on the MarkupTextView had no effect in the past because it wasn\u0027t wired to CharacterStyle.SetForegroundColor, which uses B_PANEL_TEXT_COLOR as default. With my change, calling SetHighUIColor() on MarkupTextView now calls SetForegroundColor on the CharacterStyle, effectively changing the font color. Additionally I removed a hardcoded B_PANEL_TEXT_COLOR for the list bullet points, so that they also use the text color.\nThis fixes https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/18453",
