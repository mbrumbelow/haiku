But why this number, and why enlarge the receive buffer to include all that has been received in this time frame?\n\nI must admit that I have forgotten pretty much everything about TCP in the mean time, but wouldn\u0027t it make more sense to start with a quite large receive window, and then change its size (in both directions)?",
