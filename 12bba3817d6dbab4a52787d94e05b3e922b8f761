      "message": "Yeah I did not notice this. You could fix it like I did in my old version by adding the bool `shortcutCalled`, setting that to true inside the `if (shortcut !\u003d NULL)` block, move MenusEnded() outside that block, then `return shortcutCalled`. Thinking back this is probably why I added that. My old code:\n\nhttps://review.haiku-os.org/c/haiku/+/2603/1/src/kits/interface/Window.cpp#3771\n\nI don\u0027t know, feels more and more like my old code could have been fixed up for this. Though I know it is sort of a pain taking over old Gerrit patches.",

I\u0027m not sure they were unbalanced before now, I may have unintentionally unbalanced them. Anyway, they are now rebalanced. Logic is changed to if we found a shortcut or not instead of any time command is pressed but that\u0027s a necessary change for this to all work correctly, just as it was in Ryan\u0027s patch even though Axel didn\u0027t understand why.",
