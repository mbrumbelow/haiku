      "message": "Again in my version I added a bool `shortcutCalled` for this case and set it to true in the above logic, as I don\u0027t think checking B_COMMAND_KEY is correct here. This comment is also now wrong since this was moved out of the `if`. You can see what I did and maybe adapt it to your code:\n\nhttps://review.haiku-os.org/c/haiku/+/2603/1/src/kits/interface/Window.cpp",

The underlying view could just be a text view or something that just appends every key event with modifiers.",
