      "message": "is this really how it works? If caching is a per-file-descriptor setting, it should not be handled globally.\n\nYou can have a file descriptor doing cached io and another doing direct io on the same file. The second one should not prevent the first one from being cached.\n\nThis is a bad idea if one of the two is doing writes (the other one may not immediately see them), but if they are both doing reads, it wouldn\u0027t create any problems.",
