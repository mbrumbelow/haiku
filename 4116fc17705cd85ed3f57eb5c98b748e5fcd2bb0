So it does not seem to be a great idea to use a KERNEL_LOAD_BASE in the BIOS loader, as it\u0027s ambiguous. Instead I\u0027m trying to introduce KERNEL_LOAD_BASE_32_BIT/KERNEL_LOAD_BASE_64_BIT so it will be explicitly stated when to use which load address.\n\nThis way we have arch-specific ifdef only in the arch-specific header.\n\nDisclaimer:\nRISC-V still builds, I did not check if it still boots after this change.\nNo idea about SPARC at all.\n\n",
