      "message": "HTIF makes no sense for a kernel. It\u0027s intended as a really crappy semihosting interface for bare-metal firmware. Haiku is not firmware. Depending on how your platform\u0027s HTIF support works (if it even exists), you may not even be able to use it from a kernel booted by firmware even if you wanted to, as some platforms (such as Spike) use the HTIF address specified by the tohost/fromhost symbols (or dot-prefixed sections?) in the firmware\u0027s ELF headers, which are completely unknown to an OS.",
