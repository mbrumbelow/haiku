      "message": "Some notes:\n\n1- I plan to make Terminal send the underlying shell more \"ESC codes\" for key combinations that it currently lacks (SHIFT+Ins/Del, CTRL+Ins, etc).\n\n2- Did some tests on a Linux terminal emulator (MATE-Terminal). They use CTRL+Up/Down for scrolling one line at a time.\n\nPe also uses CTRL+Up/Down in a similar way.\n\nPerhaps that\u0027s a better option than CTRL+SHIFT+Up/Down, no? I think I\u0027ll go with that on the next patchset, unless there are better alternatives.\n\n3- I was planning on adding CMD+Shift+Tab and CMD+Tab as alternatives to CMD+right and CMD+left respectively, but Terminal already uses CMD+TAB for switching between Terminal windows.\n\nOne could argue that current status-quo is \"wrong\", as \"switching between windows\" should be the task of Twitcher, no?\n\nWould removing that \"Switch Terminals\" cause people to reach for the pitchforks?",
