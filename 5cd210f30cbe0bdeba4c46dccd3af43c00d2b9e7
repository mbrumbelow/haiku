As far as I can tell, the package kit moved application icons to /boot/system/data/deskbar/menu for system-wide packages which I assume didn\u0027t exist pre-package management?\n\nEither way, this adds the ability to lookup the default system DESKBAR directory and could remove a bunch of hard-coded paths from haikuporter.",

Is there a reason why the \"deskbar/menu\" path cannot be used in whatever applications need this?\n\nIn any case, I agree that there should be a SYSTEM if there is a USER one, but i\u0027d rather do it the other way around by removing the user one.",

      "message": "So... B_USER_DESKBAR_DIRECTORY is used extensively in translation of the folder names in the deskbar.. so those would all need reworked.\n\nAre we sure we don\u0027t want a standardized finddir for \"all the application links\"?   It feels like something handy for haikuporter too vs hardcoding paths everywhere.\n\nThis really doesn\u0027t 100% tie to just the deskbar application either.  Any future desktop environments could reference B_*_DESKBAR_DIRECTORY.\n\nWould you prefer rebranding it as B_SYSTEM_APPLINK_DIRECTORY / B_USER_APPLINK_DIRECTORY or something more generic?",
