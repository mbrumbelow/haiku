As far as I can tell, the package kit moved application icons to /boot/system/data/deskbar/menu for system-wide packages which I assume didn\u0027t exist pre-package management?\n\nEither way, this adds the ability to lookup the default system DESKBAR directory and could remove a bunch of hard-coded paths from haikuporter.",

Is there a reason why the \"deskbar/menu\" path cannot be used in whatever applications need this?\n\nIn any case, I agree that there should be a SYSTEM if there is a USER one, but i\u0027d rather do it the other way around by removing the user one.",
