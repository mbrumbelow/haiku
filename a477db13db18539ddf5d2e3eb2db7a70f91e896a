      "message": "For reading xfs version 4 directories we need to use data structs ending with V4, Is there some elegant way I can handle this along with V5 structs?\n\nI managed to get block directories work with a single common struct but we should be using V4 structs for block directories as well.\n\nThere are some ways which I tried :\n\n1. Union of V4 and V5 struct.\n\n2. Handling both Versions through single V5 struct -\u003e This is quite doable for block directories, but \n   I am not able to do it for leaf directories, I tried using memcpy to get correct values by breaking \n   buffer at crc offset but that gave me either segmentation fault or illegal instruction.\n\nAny ideas on how to proceed further?\n\n",
