It doesn\u0027t add new API to select any axes values or code to do so automatically for some well-known ones if the designer didn\u0027t care.\n\nFor the NotoSansCJKjp-VF.otf named in the description, it adds Thin, Light, DemiLight, Regular, Medium, Bold and Black styles. That is, the same 7 styles we have with the 7 non-mono files in the noto_sans_cjk_jp package.\n\nFor the ShantellSans one from a comment, it adds 48 variations of weight, italic, bouncy and informal values.",

      "message": "I think there is a bit of confusion because 18381 focuses on one specific solution (rather than a problem), and this change solves at least a part of the same problem.\n\nThere are two use cases here:\n\n1) Reduce disk usage from our current Noto fonts, where we have to ship several font files with duplicated data. This change allows to ship only one font file, reducing disk usage (and maybe also RAM usage from packagefs), and still getting the same font rendering as before.\n\n2) Full support for variable fonts, which would allow us to have a fine grained control of the variable axes, allowing to set an arbitrary \"boldness\" of a font, for example (as we do for some other parameters in FontDemo already).\n\nStep 2 would be nice to have, and is what nephele expected from 18381. But step 1 is already very useful on its own, and indeed the ticket mentions both:\n\n\u003e This has the advantage that users can pretty freely pick the exact font they want, and for us it has the advantage that it saves space.\n\nThis change gets us the \"it saves space\" advantage already (but still needs the additional suggestions from Madmax for GetFTFace(), if I understand correctly, to actually use all the pre-defined font variants). Then we can update our Noto package to use a single font file instead of multiple ones for different boldnesses.",
