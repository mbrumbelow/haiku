Nothing ever iterates through or changes keyData, so in theory one of two things will happen: either 1) the condition won\u0027t be met and it will return NULL on the first pass, or 2) value will be set and it will fall out of the loop after a single iteration. Am I missing something, or is the do/while entirely unnecessary here?",
