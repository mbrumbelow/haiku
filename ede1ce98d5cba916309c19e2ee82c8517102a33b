Basically, when I first saw the pause indicator on my laptop at something less than 16x16 pixels, I was confused as to what the \"noise\" was on top of the battery icon, and only after I opened the full app did I remember after a few moments that it was a pause indicator; even there it looks like odd \"strips\" over the battery. So I think it\u0027s better if we go with something else here. I think the blue color works, but if you have other ideas, let me know.",
