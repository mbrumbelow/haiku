/*! Determine the inode number for a direntry location and return the corresponding node if it is

	@param hash A tentative location-based inode.
	@param arg Pointer to a pre-allocated uint64.
	@param td Ignored in the port.
	@param fn Ignored in the port. In FreeBSD, this is a function pointer that would be passed to
	the VFS and applied to the VFS's list of vnodes to find a match.
	@param arg Pointer to a pre-allocated uint64 that will be set to the final inode number.
	@post *arg is set to the inode number corresponding to hash (which may or may not equal hash).
	*vpp points to the corresponding BSD-style vnode, if that vnode already exists in memory. If
	the node doesn't exist in memory, *vpp is set to NULL.
	The function signature is modified to make hash a uint64 instead of uint32. This is consistent
	with the type passed by deget, and protects against overflow.
	This function never calls get_vnode when the node in question is not already registered with
	the VFS, so it is suitable for use within dosfs_read_vnode.
