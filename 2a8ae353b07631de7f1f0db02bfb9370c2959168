      "message": "\u003e Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1\n\u003e \n\u003e My existing comment is still valid. The code should be moved inside _Colorize instead of repeated whenever it is called.\n\nMy impression was that the _Colorize function is only there for setting a specific color theme for the calculator, as in when a color is dropped. It shouldn\u0027t update when the system broadcasts a new color.\n\nThe current code is also wierd in the sense that it doesn\u0027t really \"know\" if the color is custom or not.\nThis leads to beeing able to change the color sliders in the system and the calculator ignoring it untill you hit the exact color that is currently configured, at which point it will follow the system color.\n\nIt may make sense to rework this to make it very explicit whether the calculator is currently following the system color or not.\n\n",
