The code should be moved inside _Colorize instead of repeated whenever it is called.\n\nMy impression was that the _Colorize function is only there for setting a specific color theme for the calculator, as in when a color is dropped. It shouldn\u0027t update when the system broadcasts a new color.\n\nThe current code is also wierd in the sense that it doesn\u0027t really \"know\" if the color is custom or not.\nThis leads to beeing able to change the color sliders in the system and the calculator ignoring it untill you hit the exact color that is currently configured, at which point it will follow the system color.\n\nIt may make sense to rework this to make it very explicit whether the calculator is currently following the system color or not.\n\n",

It shouldn\u0027t update when the system broadcasts a new color.\n\nThat\u0027s currently true, but only because there is nothing else to do when not setting a custom color.\n\nMoving the code inside _Colorize would make it easier to have things behave consistently in all cases:\n\n- Dropping a color (or loading one from a file) sets fHasCustomBaseColor to true\n- In _Colorize, we can test if that is set, and if so, ignore system color changes\n\nThis seems simple enough to me?",
