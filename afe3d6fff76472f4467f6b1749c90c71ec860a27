      "message": "Some cleanups done in hrev56949. I have reduced this change to be a non-behavioral change only; i.e. mmc_disk and nvme_disk are not included, for now.\n\nCan we reasonably do clamping within this class? I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s feasible, because we can\u0027t know if/when the underlying device changes size (as it might for, e.g., remote_disk, virtual_disk, or something like them), so we can\u0027t cache the size; and re-fetching every invocation would trigger a lot of overhead.\n\nSo I think we can only use these generic implementations for drivers which do clamping at lower levels, like the SCSI ones do.",
