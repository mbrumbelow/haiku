      "message": "Ah you are right. Seems like I was too enthusiastic and didn\u0027t pay attention. I think it would be nice if the wrap around worked universally.\n\nThus I made some changes to the the FindNextImage function. Now I does an image rollover from both sides. It also refreshes its entry list content when the folder is modified. \n\nI verified what I believe everything, the slideshow works, folders with only one image, etc. Maybe I missed something? \n\nFurthermore I made no chagnes to the tracker navigation. Not sure what this is exactly yet, so might need to look into it a bit more.",
