      "message": "Also, regarding SSHD on Linux, it\u0027s not that common for it to be enabled by default, and sometimes it\u0027s not even included on install. Debian, for example, gives you a choice during installation if you want to include it or not, and on Fedora, you have to install it manually. I don\u0027t think having SSHD installed by default, let alone enabled, is that common, at least among mainstream distros.",
