With the Haiku default theme, the icon looked weird when an item was selected and the light grey selection colour shone through.\nThough I preferred the old icon in the dark theme (it\u0027s always a dark tick there), the white tick works, too.\n\nAny ideas about the new \"native\" flag? I was thinking, maybe the three coloured leaves from the Haiku logo arranged in a triangle.",
