      "message": "Just FYI, but while implementing this API for uACPI I\u0027ve noticed that ACPICA doesn\u0027t check whether the node it\u0027s about to return is temporary (aka created inside a method for the duration of its execution) like it does in the AcpiWalkNamespace helper, which might\u0027ve caused a few crashes or UAFs on Haiku before. Probably gone unnoticed because Linux doesn\u0027t use this API.",
