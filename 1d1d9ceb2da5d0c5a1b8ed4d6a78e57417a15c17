      "message": "The base for any commit is indeed its parent, which in this case is the abandoned change 7382. You can see that at the top in the relation chain. You can also see that in a number of ways before you push, with `git log`, for example.\n\nIf you also want those changes I would squash them into one, making sure the commit message keeps this change-id string:\n- checkout your branch (if for some reason you don\u0027t have these changes as a local branch, you can get them with `git fetch https://review.haiku-os.org/haiku refs/changes/78/7378/4 \u0026\u0026 git checkout -b change-7378 FETCH_HEAD`).\n- `git rebase -i master` will open an editor with instructions for an interactive rebase. You should see two `pick` commands with this change and its parent.\n- change the second `pick` to `squash`.\n- save and exit the editor.\n- another editor instance will open with both commit messages, edit keeping this change-id, save and exit.\n- check that now you have what you really want: `git log` to see the commits, `git show` for its contents. Compile, test, push, enjoy. If you need to correct things, add the `--amend` option when you are committing to replace your last commit instead of creating one on top of it.\n\nOr you can fetch the other commit, amend it to include this change-id in the commit message (and whatever else that may be necessary) and push that.",

      "message": "Thanks to all for the explanation, and sory for waste your time...\n\n1- The first error was that git-hook not was installed right... now i think that is working ok; so... solved that part.\n2- When i commit in my local repo, I add always the change id to the last line of the comment... sometimes, i made more than one commit localy and then push to the repo. That is ok?\n3- How i can get the latest change that PulkoMandy made? can you provide the comand to excecute (the mad-max suggest to rebase, only returns one command).\n4- No more changes for this now... but i dont know if you guys are ok with the latest changes suggered by haiku format bot; im going to mark this as resolved for now. \n\nThanks!",

      "message": "To 2: The hook should make it obsolete for you to deal with changeids, unless you beed to replace a commit completely.\n\nIf you make severall commits those will get different changeids and get a review each, this is possible, however for something like this you usually want to put all changes in one commit instead.\n\n3: Pick the download button, on mobile it is in the extra dot menu, or desktop a button i believe.\nIn it are all the different ways to download it as commands.\nThey all work a tad differently. You probably want checkout or cherry pick, the first will put your repo in a state like this is. The second will download just this patch and apply it to your local branch.
