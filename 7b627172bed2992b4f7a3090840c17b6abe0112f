We can do refactoring when it starts working as we want.\nFor now, can you please find where the code crashes and the debugger window comes as I explain it in the commit message.",

      "message": "Well, the thing is, it\u0027s easier to see problems if the code is simpler.\n\nIf there is only one function to access the mouse settings, I have to read the code only once and maybe I can see the problem. If there are two functions, I have to read each of them and carefully check everything two times.\n\nSo, the best strategy to me seems to be this: take some time to clean up the code and do things in the cleanest way possible. Rather than trying to fix all bugs in code that has become quite complex, and we have a bit lost control of what is going on where.\n\nYour changes are now quite large and trying to modify a lot of things at once. It would probably help to split them into smaller steps, for example:\n- First commit: convert the settings file from the old format to BMessage based format. Keep support for only one mouse at first. Make sure we have the loading and saving working, the migration from the old format to the new.\n- Second commit: add the API to manage multiple mouse in InterfaceDefs. On input_server side, return the same values for all mouses for now. Make Input preferences use the new API. Still no actual support for multiple mouses, but now we should have the input preferences ready to manage multiple mouses\n- Third commit: modify the input_server to really have multiple settings for different devices. This should be a relatively simple change once we have everything ready.\n\nThis way, it\u0027s possible to review and debug the first commit alone first, and only when we have this working, move on to the second and then the third one. The code to manage at one step will be a lot smaller and easier to follow. And even if later on we notice a problem, it\u0027s easier to go back and try the previous commits to see which one added the problem. When there is one big commit with all the changes, it\u0027s hard to track what happened, because everything changed at the same time.",
