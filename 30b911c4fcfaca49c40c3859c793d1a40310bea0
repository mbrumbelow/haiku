This lead to issues such as https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/solved-bfs-journal-trouble-no-it-wasnt/15661 or the system date being reset to 01.01.1970 if you try to set the current date to the 31. October in Time preferences.\n\nMy change keeps the option to use GMT time and the demo snippet in https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/19047 still works fine with it, but the fallback if GMT is *not* used is not B_ERROR but the function that was always used before the change. With this, I couldn\u0027t reproduce the issue with future dates anymore.",
