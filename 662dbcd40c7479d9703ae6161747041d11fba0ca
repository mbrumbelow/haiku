Most sentiment seemed to be against the ‚Äûopposite of windows‚Äú style.\nAlso it is not me beeing dead set against it. I discussed the change with you here (and didn‚Äôt outright -2 it). PulkoMandy was also against this specific change here at the top of the review.\n\nIt would be nice to discuss such details on the mailing list instead next time. The forum tends to devolve into unrelated talk very fast for these things.",

      "message": "Thank you for not emotionally -2‚Äôing my change, your -1 is enough to express your disapproval which is fine.\n\nWhether we discuss on forums or devel mailing list it is the same. There is no consensus here but opposite of Windows is my attempt to align with Be‚Äôs vision. If you‚Äôre coming from Windows, and you swap Ctrl and Alt you‚Äôll get the shortcuts you would expect on Windows with this change, can‚Äôt you see that? Same goes for Ctrl+Tab for Twitcher.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what I could have possibly done to make this more clear, and I think you understand so I‚Äôll take my lumps here. I still think this is the right way for Haiku to go, but you are free to disagree with me.\n\nThere is no way to make everybody happy, but I‚Äôm trying my best. I was hoping to find some more support for this idea in the Be Newsletters but they don‚Äôt do a very good job of explaining the choices they made.\n\nI created the forum topic because this is not the right place to discuss the change and PulkoMandy said he wasn‚Äôt going to read it all and so I did my best to sum up my position there giving others a chance to voice their support or disapproval, which they did.\n\nWe need somebody with authority to make a decision here‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs get JLG in here and see what he thinks. üòä",
