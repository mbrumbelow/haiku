      "message": "Thank you for not emotionally -2‚Äôing my change, your -1 is enough to express your disapproval which is fine.\n\nWhether we discuss on forums or devel mailing list it is the same. There is no consensus here but opposite of Windows is my attempt to align with Be‚Äôs vision. If you‚Äôre coming from Windows, and you swap Ctrl and Alt you‚Äôll get the shortcuts you would expect on Windows with this change, can‚Äôt you see that? Same goes for Ctrl+Tab for Twitcher.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what I could have possibly done to make this more clear, and I think you understand so I‚Äôll take my lumps here. I still think this is the right way for Haiku to go, but you are free to disagree with me.\n\nThere is no way to make everybody happy, but I‚Äôm trying my best. I was hoping to find some more support for this idea in the Be Newsletters but they don‚Äôt do a very good job of explaining the choices they made.\n\nI created the forum topic because this is not the right place to discuss the change and PulkoMandy said he wasn‚Äôt going to read it all and so I did my best to sum up my position there giving others a chance to voice their support or disapproval, which they did.\n\nWe need somebody with authority to make a decision here‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs get JLG in here and see what he thinks. üòä",

      "message": "The thing is, one major reason why alt(or command) is used for command is so that control works in the terminal. To me it is logical that this extends the same way macos does this. In the same vain is the alt-tab cmd-tab shortcuts. Those work the same on all other major OS, and for compatibility I would want this too.\n\nI don\u0027t like the inverse of windows because I do not think using the win/lin shortcut mode as a default would ever be a good idea, as a consequence we should not primarily design for \"what happens when you flip this\".\n\nThe win/lin mode (especially with that name) can always only be an approximation, not mimicking the reality of what windows does. I don\u0027t like how windows and linux deal with conflicts of shortcuts in the terminal. But that is a logical consequence of following their design (even if inverted) and we should not do it.\n\nYour proposed design on the forum to basically do what macos does avoids these conflicts completely. And in-fact can already work the way macos would do this, simply by ommiting this change.\n\nI don\u0027t see the point of trying to interpret what the Vision of BeOS was in that sense, we can never be a faithfull BeOS either, there are simply too many strings pulling Haiku into the \"modern\" era, with changed keyboard use (not to mention media keys) and expected usage patterns of a computer, that would not have held true when BeOS was still around. We have to make our own decisions, and not try to interpret the will of BeOS.\n(and really, if the only argument is \"I think this was the will of BeOS\" that is more a docmatic almost religious interpretation rather than based on any design decisions.\n\n\u003e We need somebody with authority to make a decision here‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs get JLG in here and see what he thinks. üòä\n\nI disagree, we mostly work by consensus.
