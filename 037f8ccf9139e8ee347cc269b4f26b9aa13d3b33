      "message": "NOTE: This is just a quick fix to solve an issue that has been annoying me - I do not know why this call was being made in the first place (removing it doesn\u0027t have any affect I can observe other than stopping this drawing glitch). I do not know why Window::IsVisible() is almost solely relying on whether fCurrentWorkspace is \u003e\u003d 0 for its return result. I do not know where exactly Window::IsVisible or Window::CurrentWorkspace are being used that causes this issue. And I do not know why this issue only affects some apps and not others. So if there is anyone who knows the answers to these questions, and/or knows a better way to solve this, please do mention it. Thanks!",

      "message": "Moving stacked windows works fine, which is the only one I\u0027d checked before, but it looks like this results in moving tiled windows on another workspace from Workspaces not working properly, so I guess that\u0027s why it\u0027s there. I\u0027ll see if I can fix that or find a better solution to this (I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a better way than setting them visible to do it).",

      "message": "The issue was that in the process of moving off-workspace tiled windows, SATWindow::CompleteWindowFrame and WindowArea::_MoveToSAT use the window\u0027s current workspace to determine offsets and the workspace to pass to Desktop::MoveWindowBy respectively; I\u0027ve added an invisible window member variable to Window and modified those functions to fail back to the invisible workspace if needed. \n\nDesktop::MoveWindowBy now sets the invisible workspace instead of the current workspace, so IsVisible never incorrectly returns true. So now the redraw glitch is fixed and moving tiled windows works properly again. This also fixed a minor graphical glitch that happened when moving off-workspace tiled windows, presumably from the switch from invisible to visible.",
