      "message": "NOTE: This is just a quick fix to solve an issue that has been annoying me - I do not know why this call was being made in the first place (removing it doesn\u0027t have any affect I can observe other than stopping this drawing glitch). I do not know why Window::IsVisible() is almost solely relying on whether fCurrentWorkspace is \u003e\u003d 0 for its return result. I do not know where exactly Window::IsVisible or Window::CurrentWorkspace are being used that causes this issue. And I do not know why this issue only affects some apps and not others. So if there is anyone who knows the answers to these questions, and/or knows a better way to solve this, please do mention it. Thanks!",
