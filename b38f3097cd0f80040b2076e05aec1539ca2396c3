Do not submit this yet or it will lighten the color of all button. nephele promises that he\u0027s going to adjust the tints in HaikuControlLook to make the button color match again, then both can be submitted at once.",

      "message": "But that change is in HaikuControlLook, this is a global change for all control looks. You said you wanted the color put back to 245 so I did. We don\u0027t want to tint the B_CONTROL_BACKGROUND_COLOR every time we have to use it, right now that just means in BButton since that\u0027s the only place we\u0027re currently using it, but soon (I hope) will be in a bunch more places. Either you work off of 245 or we change it to 216 and you work off that, either way the tint in BButton has got to go.\n\nCare must be taken not to re-break #12568 but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll handle that in HaikuControlLook.",
