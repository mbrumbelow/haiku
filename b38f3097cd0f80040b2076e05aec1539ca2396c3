      "message": "But that change is in HaikuControlLook, this is a global change for all control looks. You said you wanted the color put back to 245 so I did. We don\u0027t want to tint the B_CONTROL_BACKGROUND_COLOR every time we have to use it, right now that just means in BButton since that\u0027s the only place we\u0027re currently using it, but soon (I hope) will be in a bunch more places. Either you work off of 245 or we change it to 216 and you work off that, either way the tint in BButton has got to go.\n\nCare must be taken not to re-break #12568 but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll handle that in HaikuControlLook.",

I can do the proper fix and break the api as it has very recently been anyway.\n\nAnyway, feel free to review my changeset when it is done. But the new control color is a result of the rendering code improvement for the controllook, not the basis to work off of.",

I still feel that you\u0027re creating unnecessary work for yourself when you go to replace B_PANEL_BACKGROUND_COLOR with B_CONTROL_BACKGROUND_COLOR. They may be semantically different but without this tint and with the value set to 245 they will be literally different as well with the control background color having the equivalent of a permanent B_LIGHTEN_1_TINT applied to it.
