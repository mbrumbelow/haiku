      "message": "I guess the question is whether we also bestow semantic meaning to B_PRIMARY_MOUSE_BUTTON. As the (new) documentation suggests, the buttons identified by 1 and 2 are not necessarily next to each other. In fact, it does seem to refer more to the function of the button, rather than the position of the button on the physical device. \n\nSo I would be in favor of not deprecating the existing button masks.",

      "message": "This was already discussed in the first comments for this change.\n\n\"primary\"/\"secondary\" is not really semantic. Originally I had introduced new constants, B_FORWARD_MOUSE_BUTTON and B_BACK_MOUSE_BUTTON, which is how the 4th and 5th buttons are used pretty much everywhere. But reviewers did not agree and suggested to use a B_MOUSE_BUTTON_1, etc approach as is done in Dano. I find it silly to have such a set of fixed constants so I made a macro instead.\n\nThe new macro still does not correspond to the physical order of the buttons, on a typical right-handed mouse, 1 is left, 2 is right, and 3 is middle.\n\nI\u0027m fine with merging the original version of this patch if it\u0027s preferred (with B_FORWARD_MOUSE_BUTTON and B_BACK_MOUSE_BUTTON, which goes the semantic way). We\u0027ll need to find a name/meaning for the 6th mouse buttons, however, when I get to work on that (on my mouse it needs USB-HID quirks first).",
