      "message": "This change aims to move the storage of screenshot bitmaps out of the in-memory package info model and into a separate repository for screenshots. The drivers for this are broad;\n\n* \"slim down\" the in-memory model of the packages\n* avoid the possibility of excessive in-memory build-up of screenshot thumbnail bitmaps\n* avoid loading screenshot thumbnail bitmaps from the server that are not used\n* ability to trim disk-based caches of screenshot thumbnail bitmaps\n* bring the loading of screenshot thumbnail bitmaps from the server into the background process system\n\nThe PR does not functionally change any user-facing UI.",
