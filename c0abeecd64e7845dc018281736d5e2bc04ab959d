      "message": "I was trying to be polite and solicit input from other developers; also because it is perhaps somewhat subjective what BeOS/Haiku UI paradigms are or should be in this case.\n\nAs mentioned in both the commit message as well as in PoseView.cpp though, I personally think it should be mapped to an applications menu (system or user) for improved accessibility (compared to e.g. the Deskbar submenus).\n\nI could of course have temporarily mapped it to the same action as right click (bring up the desktop context menu) instead, but thought of the commit mostly as a RFC to highlight a non-tapped possibility.",

      "message": "Well here is my opinion in longer form: I think it should do nothing, unless there is a really useful thing to do.\n\nReplicating DeskBar is not an useful thing to do, there is already DeskBar for that, and it is already quite easy to reach.\n\nWe try to support two and even one-button mouse systems, so adding actions on the third button can only be things that are already easily reached in other ways.\n\nAs a result, yes, the third button is used very sparingly in Haiku.\n\nThe approach here seems to me like \"every button should do a thing, what should we wire this one to?\". I don\u0027t agree with that. It\u0027s ok that we don\u0027t need to use every button everywhere.\n\nSo, if we have a good use for it, we can implement it. Otherwise, we should just do nothing. But the \"good use\" has to come first, and then we can consider each specific idea and see what\u0027s best: use a mouse button that may not always be available? a keyboard shortcut? some other solution? And then, if we determine that third mouse button is the right way, we can implement it.",
