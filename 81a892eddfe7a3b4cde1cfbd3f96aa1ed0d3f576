      "message": "ARM does, because at the hardware level it doesn\u0027t have a way to access individual bytes of memory (there are asm instructions for it, but they are still accessing memory in 32-bit words and emulating smaller accesses with read-modify-write, which would confuse devices)\n\nHistorically, the fdt system was only for arm and so the default regshift was 2. But later it was expanded to other platforms.\n\nI don\u0027t know what the situation is on arm64, did they fix this?",
