      "message": "Thanks for taking a look; I resolved the whitespace issues. \n\nOne piece of feedback I was looking for is the fact that AppFontManager is basically a copy of FontManager with some of the functions removed, and some added - should it be a subclass, or is that odd since FontManager is a global singleton and the AppFontManager is a per-app-server instance?
