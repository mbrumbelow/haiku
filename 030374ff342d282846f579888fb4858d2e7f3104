      "message": "I still think this behavior doesn\u0027t make sense. We don\u0027t automount disks on boot unless they were previously mounted, do we?\n\nMaybe it makes sense to mount one partition automatically, but I don\u0027t think it makes sense to automount all of them. I was doing some work with old BeOS data images that have 3 or 4 partitions, mounting all those would have just been annoying when I only wanted one. So I don\u0027t think that should be the default behavior. Maybe have an option for it if we really want, otherwise, just register the disk image but don\u0027t do anything else. Or alternatively, if there\u0027s more than one partition in it, open DriveSetup with the newly registered image highlighted.\n\nBut let\u0027s see what humdinger has to say about UX concerns here.",

      "message": "I imagine most of the time an ISO image a \u0027regular\u0027 user mounts has a single partition, or in case of an OS image like our anyboot, a small EFI partition and the big data partition.\nSo, most of the time I\u0027d prefer to have a double-click actually mount all partitions, instead of just registering them and having me to manually mount the partition I need. Worst case: I\u0027ll have to unmount the unneeded partitions. I suppose normally, I\u0027ll just select them all together when I\u0027m done and do the unmounting (or I just leave them mounted until I reboot).\n\nBest solution IMO would be to mount all on double-click of the ISO, but add a \"Mount \u003e\" menu when I right-click the ISO to select a specific partition. Dunno how much effort that is though...",

      "message": "\u003e I still think this behavior doesn\u0027t make sense.\n\nThe end goal is to have double clicking the anyboot image just mount it. I think that behavior makes sense and is more intuitive than just registering the image and then having to mount the partitions. Here it is implemented by associating disk images with the mountvolume command.\n\nHowever, I have already commented in a previous version of this patch, that this should be handled by the diskimage command. Ideally it should all work automatically:\n\n- \u0027diskimage register\u0027 registers the image\n- according to the \"automatically mount disks\" setting, Tracker notices the new volumes (just like when anactual CD is inserted in a machine) and mounts either BFS partitions, all partitions, or nothing at all, depending on the setting\n- Optionally, we could add a BNotification to tell the user that the disk image is registered in the case where there is no automount. This avoids the \"nothing happens\" situation in that case.\n\nMy suggestion was rejected, and now we\u0027re trying to have mountvolume do more things than it is supposed to, and it doesn\u0027t really have the right interface to handle all cases.\n\nSo I repeat my suggestion: this would be better implemented in the diskimage tool instead of in mountvolume. I think that way we will be able to make everyone happy with the behavior.",

I tried to associate diskimage register with the anyboot MIME type but that did not work for me so I returned to mountvolume, the one that works.\n\nI have updated this patch to only mount the first partition unless you specify -all -allbfs -allhfs or -alldos parameters from the command line. Tracker mount settings are not considered. Could I read those Tracker settings in mountvolume and set the appropriate mountvolume command line options (-allbfs or -all) on double click somehow?\n\nThis only mounts the first partition if multiple are found which should alleviate waddlesplash\u0027s main complain. Only the \"Haiku\" partition is mounted when you double click on an anyboot image, not the \"Haiku esp\" partition.",
