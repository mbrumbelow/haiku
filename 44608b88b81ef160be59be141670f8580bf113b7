So I am surprised to see a \"!ehFrame\" in the test.\n\nllvm seems to also check specifically for ehframe: https://reviews.llvm.org/D80476 in the opposite direction as this patch does?",

      "message": "It\u0027d be worth noting that there are some dances around that related to supporting older versions of DWARF. The formats of .eh_frame and .debug_frame were almost, but not quite identical, so DWARF 4 did away with the latter entirely and unified them. Since we still have GCC2 libs for compat though, we need to support DWARF2 still. With respect to this change, I\u0027ll try to have a look in the next few days, it\u0027s been a while since I looked at the spec.",

      "message": "From looking a bit further, the only place this seems to be documented is the LSB ; none of the versions of the DWARF specification indicate that zero length is allowed or should be interpreted this way (and it\u0027s oddly redundant since one could just as well treat reaching the end of the CIE/FDE data the same way without needing the terminator), so this seems to be something the GCC folks decided to do out of band. Since we\u0027re using that compiler and LLVM is seemingly following suit, we need to support it, though I would remove the eh_frame check. As previously stated, newer DWARF has removed debug_frame entirely, so we will always be dealing with eh_frame in this context anyhow.",
