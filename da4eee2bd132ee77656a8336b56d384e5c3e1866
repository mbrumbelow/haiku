      "message": "A lot of the timeouts were due to a deadlock in our unnamed-sem code. Fixed in hrev57169. This reduces a lot of the differences (and fixed more tests, probably if I reran the poll tests they would be fixed there too.)\n\nI updated the gist. In this run readable_on_eof succeeded, but it still seems intermittent. Running it manually multiple times in a row has it fail with the assertion failure. shutdown_eof and others still fail outright.",
