However, now, if you have a touchpad and no mouse, you cannot reach that anymore.\n\nIt would be nice to refactor the code (and maybe also the UI?) to not duplicate all this logic, however.\n\nThere is a similar problem for the focus follows mouse setting, which is currently not visible anywhere if you only have a touchpad.",
