The rest of the cases of this bug are explained by you renaming a file yourself.\n\nUnfortunately if you type a new name without hitting Enter and then push Alt+O to open the folder, it will do the rename but the new Tracker window will say \"New folder\" in the tab instead of the name you typed, but that\u0027s a different bug...",
