      "message": "The only \"difference\" to HSV is how brightness is calculated. The brightness function is the same we use now for rgb_color::Brightness(). The alghorythm gives better results than HSL for matching what brightness color produces for human vision.\n\nThe original C code I partially based the if-else chain on is in public domain. But alghorythms themselves are not copyrightable.\n\nMore details here: http://alienryderflex.com/hsp.html",
