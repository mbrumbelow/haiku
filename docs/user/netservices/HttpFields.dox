/*!
	\class BHttpFields
	\ingroup netservices
	\brief Represents the field section of a HTTP header.

	The HTTP protocol (RFC 7230) specifies that each HTTP request and response has a header. Part
	of that header is a list of fields, which are name and value pairs. The high level protocol
	defines what valid field names and field values look like. When adding or modifying field data,
	the members of this class enforce those constraints.
	
	When you are processing a HTTP response, this object gives you the methods to query the headers
	in that response. When you are creating a HTTP request, this object gives you methods to add
	and modify header fields on your request. When retrieving data from the header fields, this
	data is often returned as an \c std::string_view. Please note that this object will only point
	to valid data for the lifetime of this object, which in case of a HTTP response, will be
	bound to the lifetime of the object that contains the HTTP response.

	When adding headers, the fields are stored in the order in which they were added. However,
	when you add additional values with an existing name, the new field will be added below the
	existing field.

	The HTTP protocol does not prohibit multiple fields with the same name, but it does note that
	semantically this is only allowed for a limited set of explicitly named headers, like the
	'Set-Cookie' field (see RFC 7230 section 3.2.2). Because most header fields will only exist
	once, the interface of this class is optimized for each header field existing only once. The
	onus is on the user to take additional steps when dealing with header fields that they know
	can occur more than once.

/*!
	\class BHttpFields::Field
	\ingroup netservices
	\brief Represents a HTTP header field.

	This type represents a combination of a field name and a field value. In order to be used in
	a HTTP header, each object must contain data that is in compliance with the HTTP specification
	(RFC 7230).

	Some official HTTP specifications give additional guidelines for how to interpret specific
	fields. This class, however, does not supply any additional parsing for those specializations.

	Manipulation of the contents of a HTTP field will in most cases be done through the interface
	of the \ref BHttpFields object that owns this field.

	This type has a special 'empty' state. This means that they do not have a key and value. Empty
	objects only come into existence when explicitly instantiated with the constructor with no
	arguments, or after the contents has been moved to another object. Empty objects cannot be
	added to \ref BHttpFields objets. You do not have to check for empty fields when working with
	fields coming from \ref BHttpFields objects.
