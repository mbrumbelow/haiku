Documents that still need to be converted to restructuredtext (or thrown away):

- kernel/vm*: it looks like these should be comments in the sourcecode?
- kits/*: TODO, some interesting info in there but also a lot of probably obsolete things
- media/*: some useful things, some sourcecode, and a PDF file about the echo audio driver

Other things to do:

- Organize the table of contents a bit. For now I just wanted to get all the existing files in,
  in a mostly flat organization. But it makes things hard to follow.
- Reorganize the directories. For example move midi to kits/midi. Should we follow the layout of
  the source tree? Or the hierarchy of the table of contents?
- There are doxyfiles for various components. Unlike the one used for API docs, they scan the cpp
  source files and will extract some internals documentation from there. Decide what to do with that.
- Migrate some things from the website. Start with documentation about configure and jam, for example.
- There are TODO lists in various places in the docs, turn them into bugreports in the bugtracker
  (including this one!)
