Implementation of UFS2 on Haiku
===============================

While making a device for testing I have used a usb drive and formatted it to
UFS2 by using the following commands in FreeBSD. Here da0 is usb.

	gpart destroy -F /dev/da0

	gpart create -s gpt /dev/da0

	gpart add -t freebsd-ufs /dev/da0

	newfs /dev/da0p1

By running the following commands you can run the implemented code of UFS2.

Commands
--------

# Building the ufs2 shell

	jam -q "<build>ufs2_shell"

To run it, use

	jam run objects/linux/x86_64/release/tests/add-ons/kernel/file_systems/ufs2/ufs2_shell/ufs2_shell <path_to_the_image>

If you are using a usb drive then you may not be able to open it so, you just
need to add sudo in the beginning of above command and make sure that you have
not mounted the usb drive.

During the implementation of the project the following links were found useful.
