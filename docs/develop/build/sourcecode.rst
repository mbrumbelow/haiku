Haiku Git Repositories
======================

Haiku uses Git for source control, combined with Gerrit for review of code changes.

All the sources for the operating system are stored in a single repository at http://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku .

Another repository contains the build tools, that is, gcc, binutils, and Jam, which are maintained
by Haiku developers.

Managing GCC and binutils updates using vendor branches
-------------------------------------------------------

The buidtools repository uses vendor branches. This concept originates from `the SVN Book <https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.advanced.vendorbr.html>`_
but applies just as well to Git. This organization allows to clearly separate the imported code
from upstream, and the changes we have made to it.

The idea is to import all upstream changes in a dedicated branch (there are currently two, called
vendor-gcc and vendor-binutils). These branches contains the sources of gcc and binutils as
distributed by the GNU project, without any Haiku changes.

The master branch can then merge new versions from the vendor branches. This allows to use Git
conflict resolution to make sure our patches are correctly ported from one version to the next.

It also makes it easy to compare the current state of our sourcecode with the upstream code, for
example to extract patches that could be upstreamed.

How to import upstream changes
..............................

Here is an example of the process used to update to a new version of binutils:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout vendor-binutils          # Move to the branch containing binutils
    git rm -rf binutils ; rm -rf binutils # Delete the existing version of binutils
    wget http://.../binutils-2.36.tar.xz  # Download the latest version
    tar xf binutils-2.36.tar.xz           # Extract the new binutils version
    mv binutils-2.36 binutils             # Move the extracted files to the right place
    git add -f binutils                   # Add the new files to git
    git commit -m "import binutils 2.36"  # Commit the files in the vendor branch
    git push origin vendor-binutils       # You can push this directly to the branch

Now this can easily be merged into the master branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout master
    git merge vendor-binutils

Review and fix the conflicts, if any, then push the changes for review on Gerrit.

Comparing our code with upstream
................................

Comparing the two versions is easy because you can refer to them by branch names:

.. code-block:: bash

    git diff vendor-binutils master -- binutils
