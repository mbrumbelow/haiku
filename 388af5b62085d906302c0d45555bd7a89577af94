Be aware, though, that it\u0027s not a straight copy, but only some parts, because listing supporting apps don\u0027t need all the complications with getting the current preferred app, SetMark()ing menu items etc.\n\nNot directly related to this patch, but would it make sense to offer something like [AddTranslationItems](https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/tree/src/kits/translation/TranslationUtils.cpp#n842), which fills a menu with the available translators, to get a menu of supporting apps for some filetype?",
