      "message": "Looks nice, and seems to work fine... as long as I release the D key fast enough.\n\nIf I delay too long in doing so, it seems to attempt to minimize/restore in rapid succession, until it confuses itself, and only one window gets restored.\n\n(tested having Terminal, Pe, and 4 Tracker windows open)\n\nIf I change the shortcut to B_OPTION_KEY + D (no other change), it gets even funkier: having the mentioned windows open, I hit OPT+D, release D, only the active window get minimized until I release OPT (then the rest of the windows get minimized). Before releasing OPT, Tracker seems to spike its CPU usage (on the threads for the affected windows). The longer the hold, the longer the high CPU usage remains.\n\nOn the Input preflet, my \"Key repeat rate\" is at maximum, and the \"Delay until key repeat\" is at minimum. That, plus my PC being slow... I bet are making things worse in this case.\n\nCan others reproduce this?",
