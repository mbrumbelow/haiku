      "message": "The low battery condition should be 15% OR 30 minutes left, whatever is higher.\nI don\u0027t think this needs to be configurable at all.\n\nThis should just be two sound files you can set in the sound preferences, one for low battery and one for battery charged and played once only.\nUsers can then set or not set the sound file based on weather they want an acoustic cue too or not. Please don\u0027t add the options to the powerstatus but just in the existing sound preferences.\n",
