It\u0027s only the call itself that is improved, but if it\u0027s only called in a single case, I don\u0027t really see the benefit when you just can define the dryRun variable beforehand.

That we are, in that code, in the renderer is known and should not be repeated for any ops. and \"flags \u0026 kUnderline\" makes this clear to me what is beeing asked.\n\nYour example of having to write AGGTextRenderer::STRING_RENDERER_DRY_RUN seems even worse for code readability.\n\nSeeing as we are in a .cpp file here that should not be included (or leak symbols) it\u0027s probably fine to declare these with the kNames, and omit the context of \"we are in the string rendering code\" from each constants name.",
