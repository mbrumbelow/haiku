      "message": "this conversion looks more like platform than arch, e.g. it\u0027s different between bios_ia32 and efi (incl. x86/x86_64)\n\nbasically efi and riscv platforms need some proper conversion (but the same logic would be needed if we have a \"raw virt\" loader for any other architectures) as they activate the memory map only as a last step before jumping to the kernel\n\nother loaders like bios, *_m68k, u-boot (and probably openfirmware?) seem to do it in a \"map as you go\" with the memory map activated early in the bootloader initialization",
