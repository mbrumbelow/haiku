      "message": "I intentionally did not do that.\n\nMy understanding is that the bsd includes can be completely removed from the include path (indeed, when building Haiku, headers/compatibility/bsd is not part of the default search path).\n\nSo, the headers which are in posix/ should not rely on bsd/ being in the include search path. But they can rely on headers/ being there, and refer to BSD headers by full path.\n\nIf we want to use \u003cfeatures.h\u003e we have options:\n- Always add headers/compatibility/bsd to the include path (but it can be tricky to ensure strict ANSI/POSIX compatibility then)\n- Move features.h out of the bsd directory if it is used in POSIX headers\n- Rework the two affected headers (regex.h and ftw.h) to split the parts that are GNU or BSD extensions and use include_next as we do for the other headers (not sure if that is possible in this case, it looked unconvenient at least because it\u0027s not just a few extra functions).",
