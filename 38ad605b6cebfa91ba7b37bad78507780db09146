      "message": "Ok, here\u0027s an alternate implementation that uses an \"AppFontManager\" instead of the \"owner\" paradigm from before. It works but doesn\u0027t really address adding styles to a system family (it adds a new \"user\" family), and the app fonts don\u0027t show up in `count_font_families` for example. I decided to post this review for comments before worrying about details like that. Thanks!",
