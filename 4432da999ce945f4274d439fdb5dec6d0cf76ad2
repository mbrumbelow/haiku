      "message": "actually... do non-8250 UARTs need this at all?\n\nThe reason the regShift exist is because the original 8250 UART is designed for 8-bit I/O ports, but ARM and other platofrms prefer to use 4byte aligned addresses.\n\nBut in the case of PL011, the registers are already 32-bit as it is designed specifically for ARM. And so, no regShift should ever be needed.\n\nThe fact that the coed here use In32/Out32 makes me think it doesn\u0027t expect the register addresses to need a shift.",

      "message": "The shift seems to exist universally in dtb however.  It\u0027s a field for all potential devices, which means all of our drivers should expect it.\n\nHere are the knowns:\n\n* arm and arm64 universally to omit reg-shift, but assume you do reg-shift 2\n  * however, i\u0027m assuming if a dts provides reg-shift on arm, it should \"override\" the default of 2\n  * pl011 devices also specify a reg-shift of 2 in dts.\n* riscv64 specifies the reg-shift, and seem to assume 0\n* x86 wants a reg-shift of 0 in a lot of cases.\n* ppc - unknown\n* sparc - unknown (you might be able to fill us in here)\n\nThere are a lot of universal cases here, and the 8250\u0027s aren\u0027t the only devices with reg-shifts.\n\n\nHere\u0027s some data.
