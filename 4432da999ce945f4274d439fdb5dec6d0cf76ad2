      "message": "actually... do non-8250 UARTs need this at all?\n\nThe reason the regShift exist is because the original 8250 UART is designed for 8-bit I/O ports, but ARM and other platofrms prefer to use 4byte aligned addresses.\n\nBut in the case of PL011, the registers are already 32-bit as it is designed specifically for ARM. And so, no regShift should ever be needed.\n\nThe fact that the coed here use In32/Out32 makes me think it doesn\u0027t expect the register addresses to need a shift.",
