      "message": "a comment with a link to the corresponding documentation would be helpful here\n\nI guess it is https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0406/b/System-Level-Architecture/Virtual-Memory-System-Architecture--VMSA-/Translation-tables/Translation-table-entry-formats\n\nand the \"L2\" in the define means we must look at second level descriptors\n\nWe should also be careful that the S bit is used for something else (disabling caches) and that will be needed, what\u0027s the plan here?\n\nAlso I don\u0027t really understand from the code or the commit message what a \"dirty bit modifier\" actually is. Maybe you can elaborate on that and on why it is needed?",
