      "message": "Yes, but I don\u0027t understand how (or if) that\u0027s a problem. If it\u0027s not allowed to have both ACPI and FDT, at least we shuold add a comment explaining what problems that would cause.\n\nI guess one possible reason is we could end up with detecting the same hardware twice from different methods?\n\nAlso I find it questionable that FDT is first. Should we priorize that? Should we pick ACPI first if it\u0027s available?\n\nAnyway, the if/else is not there anymore, so I guess that solves it for now and we\u0027ll see if we run into problems with having both at the same time?",
