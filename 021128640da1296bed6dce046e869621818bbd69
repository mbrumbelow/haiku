      "message": "So the rootInodeNumber is 128.\nHere is how things look when xfs_shell is started and an ls is performed:\n\u0027.\u0027, \u0027..\u0027, \u0027myfs\u0027 (a few xfs_read_stat calls are made during this and myfs which xfs_shell treats as root directory. It shows correct dir size and other stats)\n\nNow when you cd into myfs (the root dir) and ls, it fails\nThe process is such. There is a xfs_lookup performed on \u0027.\u0027 and we successfully return 128 as the inode number. Then some get_vnodes are performed internally and I confirmed that they look for 128 inode# only. But then xfs_read_stat is called internally and, here is the thing, it access the privateNode associated to 128. I printed the inode number and I get garbage value. My best guess it that there is an issue with Inode publishing.\n\nPastebin for some output (it\u0027s not pretty :P): https://pastebin.com/1BUPsZu4",
