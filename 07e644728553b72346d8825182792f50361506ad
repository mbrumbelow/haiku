      "message": "The C++ experimental scope_exit only has one variety, which is also the function object and a bool. The reason they have one variety, is that for correctness, the object needs to be deactivated if it is moved. See: https://git.haiku-os.org/buildtools/tree/gcc/libstdc++-v3/include/experimental/scope and https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/scope_exit\n\nI think that if we are going to want to force users to use this correctly,we are going to have to make the Detachable version the default (i.e. just have one, like PulkoMandy said).",

      "message": "The current ScopedExit seems to expect to solve this by using a move on the underlying F type. Indeed I\u0027m not sure this will work in all cases.\n\nSo, should we remove that move constructor to be safe about that, then?\n\nPersonally I would lean towards having only a ScopedExit which can always be detachable. Even if there is some overhead, it will be easier to use, which I think is more important until proven otherwise.",
