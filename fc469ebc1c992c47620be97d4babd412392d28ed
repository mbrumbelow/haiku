      "message": "Hey all! I think this is the last issue before this patch is merge ready; any help with this would be appreciated since I can\u0027t find any examples of a single file being built on x86_gcc8, only whole packages. There\u0027s no reason this library can\u0027t be on x86 other than because of the features in gcc8, so I think it would be nice to keep it in somehow.",
