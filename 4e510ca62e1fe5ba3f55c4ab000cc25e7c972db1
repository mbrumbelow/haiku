At least in EFI, it\u0027s actually wrapping an EFI platform_bootloader_address_to_kernel_address (and its partner platform_kernel_address_to_bootloader_address), which is doing a bunch of work of tracking pages and a temporary memory map prior to the EFI call to actually set the virtual memory map, which is done as one of the very last steps prior to kernel hand-off.\n\nI\u0027d imagine we\u0027d need to do similar VM setup on other arches.",
