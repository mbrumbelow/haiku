      "message": "I don\u0027t think we should use up the last bits just to do this. Using symbol versioning with this structure may not be sufficient because if other libraries pass it around between them and applications, then changing it will also break those libraries\u0027 ABI, not just libroot\u0027s ABI. So we should not take up such bits arbitrarily.\n\nIf POSIX really requires these flags, then let\u0027s leave them as 0, and Wine or other applications can check `#if CS5 \u003d\u003d 0`. If POSIX doesn\u0027t, then let\u0027s delete them altogether. But I don\u0027t think we should take up bitspace for them simply because one application uses them in a strange way.",

      "message": "It\u0027s hardly a \"strange\" way. It checks them, and sets the width accordingly. That is the one thing these things are good for. I don\u0027t see why it is somehow bad that they use a switch case for this. You\u0027d get the same problem with any other library or application that supports systems that have 5 or 6 width here.\n\nThis has another annoying side-effect, if you\u0027d actually request something with CS5 or CS\u0026 this will get through but silently become a CS7 instead, that to me is just *literally* broken. No matter if you want to support this or not.\n\nPosix should have a feature flag, or remove these. But it doesn\u0027t. We implement the rest, and we should implement this properly or not at all.\n\nHow is it any better to let implementations check for this value instead?",

So patching Haiku just to make Wine slightly happier, especially if it uses up the last free bit here, seems overkill.\n\nIn POSIX, it says:\n\n\u003e The implementation shall support the functionality associated with the symbols CS7, CS8, CSTOPB, PARODD, and PARENB.\n\ni.e. there\u0027s no requirement to support CS5 or CS6.\n\nFurthermore, the standard for `tcsetattr` states:\n\n\u003e The tcsetattr() function shall return successfully if it was able to perform any of the requested actions, even if some of the requested actions could not be performed. It shall set all the attributes that the implementation supports as requested and leave all the attributes not supported by the implementation unchanged.\n\nSo returning error if CS5 or CS6 is set is actually wrong according to the spec, it should fall back to a supported width anyway.

      "message": "\u003e Because we shpuld follow posix and not ask projects for some ridicilous workarounds?\n\nAs already discussed, POSIX does not require these constants to have different values, and also explicitly does not require us to correctly implement them (it does require us to define them, that\u0027s all, and it is very clear about that).\n\nSo, the argument about POSIX support is not valid here. You have already argued that this is \"following the letter and not the spirit\" of the spec, but that argument isn\u0027t acceptable. The specification is what\u0027s written in the specification, there is no \"spirit\".\n\nSo, you have to find another way to justfiy this. The argument that CS5 and CS6 are silently converted to CS7, instead of returning errors, is a valid one, for example, but as waddlesplash says, POSIX doesn\u0027t agree on that. You can bring that complaint to POSIX and have them fix the next version of the spec.\n\n\u003e we have lots of ncurses applications and TUI tools but they don\u0027t seem to\n\nThese flags are for serial port management, not for pseudo-ttys. So you are looking at the wrong place here. Tools like minicom, gtkterm, ... and any other that uses serial ports will surely want to use these flags in some way. TUI apps have no reason to do so.\n\n\u003e Using symbol versioning with this structure may not be sufficient because if other libraries pass it around between them and applications\n\nI am confused by this argument. We use symbol versioning for struct stat, which is very similar and just as likely to suffer from the same problem. And that appears to not cause a lot of problems.\n\n\u003e These vars beeing the same is wrong. Simple as that.\n\nIt is actually allowed by POSIX. So there is nothing \"wrong\" here. It is annoying, maybe, but it is not wrong.",
