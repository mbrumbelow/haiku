      "message": "As discussed on IRC: enabling ECAM without disabling the \"x86\" module would break the system badly (maybe even dangerously) by having duplicated PCI domains. This prevents that entirely.\n\nIf someone really wants to use the full ECAM module (i.e. including FDT, but why would you want that?) on x86, they will already have to edit Jamfiles, so this adds a place in the source code to edit. Plus, it also tells anyone reading this code that this mechanism is *not* used for probing on x86.",

We already have issues with things like Thunderbolt PCIe bus extension... given how far out we are from the next stable release, maybe now would be a good time to test ECAM on x86?\n\nI guess at minimum this could all be tested in a follow-up commit that could be easily reverted if needed.",

If developer enable components disabled by default (usb_audio, ecam etc.) it is expected that developer knows what he is doing. Triggering build error in weird place and need to fix it again and again is a headache for developer.",
