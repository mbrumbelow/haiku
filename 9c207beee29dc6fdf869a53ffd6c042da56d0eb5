At the time I added handling for them, they were being emitted by gcc while the updated standards were still in draft (unless one passed `-gstrict-dwarf`, which most projects did not). It\u0027s possible that now that the standards are finalized, gcc is no longer using them, which would simplify this code a bit.",
