      "message": "One more thing, I apologize if this is obvious an so doesn\u0027t need to be stated, but I don\u0027t think it is. If you have assigned B_NO_COMMAND_KEY to a shortcut it does not prevent the shortcut from being triggered when B_COMMAND_KEY (i.e. Alt) is held down, it simply ignores the modifier. So if you have a shortcut that triggers on Control for example, and you have both Control and Command (Alt) held down down, it _will_ trigger the shortcut since B_CONTROL is down. For all other shortcuts, we will not trigger the shortcut _unless_ B_COMMAND_KEY (Alt) is held down. Let\u0027s say you have a shortcut assigned to (B_NO_COMMAND_KEY | B_CONTROL_KEY) + T and you have another shortcut assigned to B_COMMAND_KEY + T. Which one wins if you have both Control and Command held down? The B_NO_COMMAND_KEY, i.e. Control+T shortcuts wins in this case.\n\nIf this were to be a problem we could disallow triggering B_NO_COMMAND_KEY shortcuts when B_COMMAND_KEY (Alt) is held down, but I don\u0027t think this is a problem, it\u0027s merely an idiosyncrasy of the precedence rule set in BWindow that you need to be aware of.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t quite understand your example. What happens depends on what shortcuts are defined, ctrl-s would win over cmd-s if you have both defined in the app and both held, cmd-s loses. It is meant to work much the same way as it already does which is to be permissive. We match the first shortcut we find matching all the criteria even if you have extra modifiers not needed, in other words we\u0027re not strict with modifiers.\n\nBut there is a conflict introduced with this that shortcuts can be defined with command, another modifier, or command with another modifier. Since I check the non-command ones first, that\u0027s the one I go with, otherwise I check the command version. I have to choose which gets overridden one way or the other and effectively I already have. But we could change it to be the other way around with command overriding control instead if that works better.\n\nHowever I\u0027m not sure there is a bug to fix. We should not, we should allow the trigger to proceed with or without command even though that means the non-command version will trigger before the command version, and thus override it. There are more examples where it would hurt to disallow the shortcut with command held down than it would help to not trigger the shortcut, but I\u0027m not completely sure.\n\nConsidering that any non-command shortcuts we want we have to add in after this change, it makes sense that they should override the existing command version.\n\nPlease understand that this whole discussion only applies when you have overlapping modifiers held, so if you have just cmd or just ctrl held there\u0027s no conflict and no overrides. If you have both command and control held down though, then it has to make a decision, should it trigger the command or the control shortcut? If you have a shortcut that requires both command and control  that one is going to win over either cmd or ctrl versions of course.",

Though I think you also would need to change `AllowedModifiers` to not always add B_COMMAND_KEY.\n\nBecause this is a \"flag\", not an actual modifier, I think it will make things more sane if it is only referenced when the shortcut is created.

      "message": "I\u0027m not trying to be difficult or contrary here but I\u0027m trying to say that Adrian is indeed missing something with his suggestion. B_NO_COMMAND_KEY is not a \"real\" shortcut, there is no B_NO_COMMAND_KEY on your keyboard to press. Here in BWindow we are looking for the shortcut and triggering on KeyDown. This is the only place that shortcuts get triggered an never in BMenuItem. So if you change this, you\u0027ll break the feature and this change can not, or at least should not be moved to BMenuItem since BMenuItem doesn\u0027t check for modifiers in KeyDown and there are two ways to add a shortcut, by adding a BMenuItem with a Shortcut assigned _or_ by adding the shortcut to BWindow (well your BWindow sub-class anyway).\n\nWhether you added a shortcut via BWindow::AddShortcut() or the BMenuItem constructor the shortcut is triggered here in BWindow and nowhere else, never in BMenuItem. BMenuItem only sets the shortcut, same as BWindow does making sure to set either B_NO_COMMAND_KEY or B_COMMAND_KEY.\n\nSo while there may be some confusion here, it absolutely must be implemented this way to work. We must check for B_NO_COMMAND_KEY in BWindow, we must look for a Shortcut with B_NO_COMMAND_KEY before we look for one with B_COMMAND_KEY.\n\nMaybe the shortcut system could be reworked to check in the BMenuItem::KeyDown method instead, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea since BMenuItem may or may not be involved, while BWindow always is.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if this is clear from reading the code or not, but we don\u0027t actually assign B_NO_COMMAND_KEY when we set a shortcut. We look it and if it\u0027s there, we make sure that B_COMMAND_KEY is removed, but otherwise we set the shortcut modifiers _without_ B_NO_COMMAND_KEY assigned.\n\nSo when we check this in BWindow a similar thing happens, we tack B_NO_COMMAND_KEY on, but then we immediately remove it along with B_COMMAND_KEY, then look for the shortcut with the rest of the (allowed) modifiers to see if you have one, then if that doesn\u0027t find a shortcut we check to make sure that you have B_COMMAND_KEY held down (i.e. you are holding Alt) and then see if there\u0027s a shortcut.\n\nThis is a bit convoluted but it is necessary for backwards compatibility. The presence of the B_NO_COMMAND_KEY on a shortcut enables you to have a shortcut without B_COMMAND_KEY, in fact you cannot have B_COMMAND_KEY assigned to the shortcut. But B_NO_COMMAND_KEY is \"magic\" i.e. it doesn\u0027t get added.\n\nSo we have to check for a shortcut with B_NO_COMMAND_KEY _first_ then check for a shortcut while making sure you are holding B_COMMAND_KEY _second_. It must happen in that order to work correctly.\n\nI hope the above makes sense and I\u0027m not missing something obvious.",
