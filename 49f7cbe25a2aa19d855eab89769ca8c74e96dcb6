      "message": "So.  We provide the kernel linker scripts on most if not all architectures.\nWhy do we want to depend on the built-in gcc spec linker script for riscv64?\n\nI\u0027m a bit concerned about changes to the built-in spec between gcc versions leading to breakages of our kernel booting.\n\n\nThen again, the counter to this is how our arm port broke due to the arm ini/fini_array change.  Our linker script was using the older standard, and gcc in 8 started doing ini/fini_array instead of ctors/dtors.",

      "message": "What future changes do you mean? I think that letting linker do its job without altering by linker script is better suited to future changes of compiler and linker. Linker script is not really needed for kernel on any architecture. Linker script may be needed only for boot loaders that use RAW format. Kernel is proper ELF executable. Haiku has an advantage of using own boot loader to load kernel so it allow complex kernel loading operations and preparations (relocations etc.). It is already work fine on riscv64.\n\nx86[_64] need nore work for support code patching. Code patching table section can be created with the same method as crti.o/crtn.o.",
