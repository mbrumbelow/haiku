      "message": "So.  We provide the kernel linker scripts on most if not all architectures.\nWhy do we want to depend on the built-in gcc spec linker script for riscv64?\n\nI\u0027m a bit concerned about changes to the built-in spec between gcc versions leading to breakages of our kernel booting.\n\n\nThen again, the counter to this is how our arm port broke due to the arm ini/fini_array change.  Our linker script was using the older standard, and gcc in 8 started doing ini/fini_array instead of ctors/dtors.",
