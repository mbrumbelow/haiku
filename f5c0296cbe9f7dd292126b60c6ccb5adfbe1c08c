It suggested adding \"#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e\", which didn\u0027t helped anyway :-).\n\n\n\nSide note (just being curious)... I\u0027ve noticed that some of these power/acpi_* drivers have `Depends` on `acpi` on their Jamfiles, but others do not. Shouldn\u0027t all of them depend on the acpi module?",
