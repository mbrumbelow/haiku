      "message": "This one is pretty minor, but makes logs a lot easier to parse in bulk.\n\nA good example is here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/kallisti5/142b2e0ca241dbf7eb0efb8475caa172\n\nmost things log as \"thing: blah blah\", however a few like the package kit do package_kit [timestamp: blah] .....\n\nBy adding a : after the DEBUG_APP, it makes everything overall more consistent (we can start analyzing which components throw the most errors, etc)\n\ni\u0027m open to other ideas to improve standardization, but this is a pretty quick and easy fix without changing too much.",
