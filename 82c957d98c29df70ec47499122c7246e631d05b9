      "message": "This one is pretty minor, but makes logs a lot easier to parse in bulk.\n\nA good example is here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/kallisti5/142b2e0ca241dbf7eb0efb8475caa172\n\nmost things log as \"thing: blah blah\", however a few like the package kit do package_kit [timestamp: blah] .....\n\nBy adding a : after the DEBUG_APP, it makes everything overall more consistent (we can start analyzing which components throw the most errors, etc)\n\ni\u0027m open to other ideas to improve standardization, but this is a pretty quick and easy fix without changing too much.",

      "message": "\u003e Maybe it\u0027s time to start thinking about standardizing it?\n\nI\u0027ll be working on trying to improve serial_mouse logging (which has some left overs from when we where replacing BeOS components one at a time, along with my crappy code).\n\nBesides logging to syslog, another usual pattern I\u0027ve seen over the years is that... it is really convenient to have a \"private log\" when in the early stages of working on some driver/module/addon. It is nicer to have just \"your\" output, and not have it mixed along with the rest of syslog\u0027s output.\n\nIt would be nice if there was a \"standard\" way for that use case, and several drivers could benefit from switching to that common code too (one that comes to mind is the ES1370 driver\u0027s debug.{h,c}).",
