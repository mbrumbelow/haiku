I thought the idea was to generate the colors. not copy the previous ones, anyhow.\n\nWhen the 3 colors specified are the defaults, then all the other colors generated should also be equivalent (or so close as to be indistinguishable) from the other defaults. If we change the generator, we should change the defaults, too.\n\n\u003e Blending with the status color works nicely to get a bit of flair. \n\nBut this is the background color for controls. I don\u0027t think it should have yellow \"flair\", it should remain a neutral grey.\n\n\u003e this code needs to adjusted since the previous computation would always return a white control background\n\nSure, of course, but not like this I don\u0027t think.\n\nYes, I\u0027m aware the dark mode default colors need to be changed, I was looking at that a bit. For one thing the dark colors are probably too dark and we should be using a deep gray/blue-gray instead.",

If so i\u0027ll just do the IsDark check and do a different tint then, to fix the immidieita problem.\n\nFor the fallback colors, I wouldn\u0027t bother with that yet. If you change the generator in respect to the dark colors substantially we can talk about what looks good and what doesn\u0027t. Currently there are still too many rendering issues in controls to really have a good picture IMO.",
