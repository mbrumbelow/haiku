      "message": "I intended to make this check in `tty_create_cookie` so that any consumer of the TTY module would be subject to the exclusive check. However, as the API returns a pointer instead of a `status_t`, there is no way to communicate the `B_BUSY` status code, and every consumer would think of that as a `B_NO_MEMORY` instead.\n\nCurrently, the other consumers of TTY (serial ports and master TTYs) don\u0027t seem to share TTYs but instead create a new `struct tty` every time `open` is called so I guess this check should be here.",
