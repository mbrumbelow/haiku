This should be used for x86 as well when PCI busses are discovered from ACPI, and ideally on RISC-V as well when discovered from FDT (but that will require some refactoring).\n\nRISC-V currently has its own ECAM implementation (and also supports some non-ECAM-compatible controllers in addition).\n\nSo, this should actually be moved outside of the ARM specific arch directory for the most part.",
