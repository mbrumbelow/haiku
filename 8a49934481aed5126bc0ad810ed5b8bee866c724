      "message": "The interface is already deleted on detach. I think it happens by the network stack closing and freeing it after the read function returns an error. I don\u0027t fully understand how the network stack manages the devices, but I will have to dig into that a bit deeper: the network stack does not pick up the interface again when it is re-plugged later, which is what I was investigating with these changes.\n\nThe specification calls the address OID_802_3_PERMANENT_ADDRESS, but on my phone it changes every time. There isn\u0027t really any description in the specification, other than the name.\n\nAlso, handling this at the driver level creates some other problems:\n\n- The way it is done with an array of devices limits how many devices can be attached to the driver (for example usb_ecm is already modified to not need that)\n- It adds complexity in the driver to manage the case where the device is not connected, but the network stack is still trying to access it\n- This code needs to be implemented in each driver\n\nIn the end, I\u0027m starting to think this is a bad idea, and it would be simpler to move the \"is this a known interface?\" checks and handling higher up in the network stack, so it can be implemented once there, and benefit all drivers. I think doing it the way it is done now was useful in BeOS where there wasn\u0027t great support for hot plugging of network interfaces, but that\u0027s a problem we can solve in a better/cleaner way.",

      "message": "That all makes sense to me.\n\nThe removal happens at the stack level if a read returns B_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND, though: https://grok.nikisoft.one/opengrok/xref/haiku/src/add-ons/kernel/network/stack/device_interfaces.cpp?r\u003d819c51084f7431b498316e43a2dc7f5b2102ef3b#48\n\nSo if the read function returns something other than DEVICE_NOT_FOUND it will just add to the error counter and won\u0027t be removed. Not sure why the network stack doesn\u0027t pick it up again, though.",
