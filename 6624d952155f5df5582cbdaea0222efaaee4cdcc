      "message": "We do have write support in here because of the bootloader feature to dump the previous syslog to a file. So, it\u0027s not quite as simple as you might think.\n\nAlso the FAT implementation in the kernel filesystem driver is ... not great, we inherited it from BeOS and it could use an awful lot of refactoring. This might be a good basis for refactoring that.",
