      "message": "Would you like to reconsider?\n\nI see that it is calculated for an 80-column terminal window. It would be understandable if it was a rather compact progress bar, like:\n\nProgress: [\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d] 100%\n\nWhere size is kept small and each segment represents a 10% range. However, this one is fixed for a 80-column window, and normally it would be expected to adopt to whatever window width there is.\n\nMost people use bigger terminal windows, and current way looks like the software is designed for 80-column-screen terminals.\n\nAll the other package managers or download utilities use full window width (apt, wget etc.). I am not sure why this one wouldn\u0027t.",

      "message": "I think the behavior those other package managers use is a bit odd, if I\u0027m being honest. When a progress bar is of a reasonable size one can look at it at a glance and see how far along it is. When it\u0027s in the middle of a wide terminal, then one might have to look back and forth to see how wide it is, and it\u0027s harder to tell where the value is proportionally within it.",

      "message": "That\u0027s a valid point, but may sound subjective. Unless it\u0027s one of those giant curved monitors, it\u0027s still in a person\u0027s comfortable eyesight (plus the vibrant color in pkgman makes it very obvious - and I don\u0027t think anyone would use a terminal *that* big). The percent value (which is the ultimate SoT) is left aligned, therefore it is on the same side as the prompt, at the very primary visual direction.\n\nI\u0027d argue the absence caused by the early-cut progress bar looks like a calculation and porting error. As if you\u0027re running those old BeOS programs with broken layout and clipped text everywhere (digging Becasso these days).\n\nI understand if you feel partial to the aesthetic, but adjusting this might have merit IMHO. Wanna give it a try for a couple of days? :)",
