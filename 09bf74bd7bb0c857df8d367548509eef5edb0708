I can take a look at that if nobody else has time to.",

Yes, of course eventually this should be done in userland, but until then, let\u0027s at least do things in the proper way.\n\nAs for floating point in the kernel, either we support it, or we don\u0027t. Allowing multiplications and divisions but not square roots makes no sense.",
