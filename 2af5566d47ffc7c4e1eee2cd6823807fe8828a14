This is 100% an xy issue (and I noted as much in the ICU bug at https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-21920)\n\nI think matching FreeBSD is prudent since we don\u0027t want to have the absolute lowest max argument size.",

It won\u0027t use any more memory than currently, and will future proof us for more insane binaries that\u0027ll work on Linux but not Haiku.",
