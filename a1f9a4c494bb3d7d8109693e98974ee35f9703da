How could it possibly be that bad? That seems like a problem already!",

      "message": "Thanks dude,\n\nYeah it’s pretty silly. With just one CPU the utilization is 100% so there isn’t enough CPU to get higher throughput. There is definitely a silly bottleneck here. I have some profiler snapshots that I need to pour over to figure out what it is.",

Also there\u0027s scheduling_recorder, but that\u0027s probably not useful when you have 100% CPU usage (but it will probably be extremely useful when debugging the performance problems that happen at lower CPU usages.)",
