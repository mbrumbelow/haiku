MTRR)\n\nthis one should also close defect #12667\n\nmemory type 0x10000000 is B_MTR_UC i.e. uncached which I\u0027d like to implement as either strongly-ordered (TEX\u003d0, B\u003d0, C\u003d0) or maybe shared device memory (TEX\u003d0, B\u003d1, B\u003d0)  - but B_MTR_WC might be a better mapping for the latter one.",
