      "message": "This value is only read and written by this same thread, not any others. So the memory ordering should be irrelevant.\n\nThe only way I can see a problem even potentially happening is if a page fault happens while we are incrementing or decrementing the value. But even then it should not cause any problems even if we are interrupted right there. And I don\u0027t know how that could happen anyway, we are in the kernel where page faults usually shouldn\u0027t happen.",
