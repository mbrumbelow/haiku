I have better intentions than skills or knowledge, so I\u0027ll welcome any insights regarding this change.\n\nI didn\u0027t saw the point of TextSearch reacting to changes in a file\u0027s attributes, when only working/showing on its content. What am I missing?\n\nI\u0027ve tested by watching on the console which fields were changed with Pe after an open/close without any other changes. B_STAT_CHANGE_TIME was the only that consistently appears (I assume due to Pe changing its own attributes for the file).\n\nGrep gets still called if one modifies/saves the file from Pe, for example.\n\nThanks in advance.",
