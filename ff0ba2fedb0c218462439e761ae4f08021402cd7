      "message": "So.  aCube made a \"Parthenope boot loader 0.93\" it uses for getting into AmigaOS from u-boot that looks really simple.  You could potentially jump into haiku\u0027s \"parthenope platform loader\" and make a bunch of hardware assumptions which would simplify things a lot.\n\n\nWith that said, aCube never upstreamed anything as mmu_man said.\n\nSo, options:\n\n1) We merge this and drop u-boot completely (and drop Sam 4xx)\n2) We remove all the non-powerpc u-boot code instead of all u-boot code\n\n\nAs a reminder, the u-boot loader\u0027s build was broken by the recent fdt work.   arm,arm64,riscv64,x86_64,x86 all use EFI or bios loaders.  The last remaining platform to potentially use the u-boot loader is the sam4xx powerpc boards\n\n\nI don\u0027t have plans to spend time on the native u-boot loader.  I think mmu_man would be the only person potentially interested in maintaining it.",
