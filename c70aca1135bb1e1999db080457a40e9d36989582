      "message": "IterateBezierTo receives 3 points, 2 of them are the control points for the curve, and the last is where the curve ends.\n\nThe start point of the curve is implied to be the current pen position.\n\nI don\u0027t understand how the code works without this last AddPoint, this means the last curve does not get its last point added to the shape.\n\nThis may work by accident for closed paths (where IterateClose will be called) where the starting and ending points happen to be the same, but in the general case, this seems not correct.\n\nMaybe, instead of this, IterateClose should check if the last and first point are equal, and if so, remove the last point.\n\nThere may be no visible consequences of this when using pasted text, because the text may always be rendered with identical starting and ending point for each glyph. Or maybe it will be visible only with some fonts.\n\nAm I missing something?",
