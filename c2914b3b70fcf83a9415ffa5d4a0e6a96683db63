This is the reason we had switched to mawk in the first place in https://review.haiku-os.org/c/haiku/+/3356 (in addition to crashes in gawk multibyte support, preventing to build Haiku using it, but I think this has since been fixed).\n\nCan the gawk_x86 package be buit in a way that we don\u0027t need to also provide mawk here?",
