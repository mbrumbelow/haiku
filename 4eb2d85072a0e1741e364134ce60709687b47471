      "message": "There are a few places where this will be useful, most notably in the new TUN/TAP driver which will use FIFOs for queues, but will occasionally need to interrupt waits. Without this change, the FIFO semaphores can\u0027t be used for waiting and a complicated dance with condition variables has to be implemented instead. With this change, we can simply B_RELEASE_ALL with B_INTERRUPTED and everything should work out.",
