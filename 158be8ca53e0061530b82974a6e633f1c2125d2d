      "message": "So.. bootstrapping ICU 70 for every architecture will take a while and not be done all at once.\nWith that in mind, icu70-70.1 provides ICU \u003e\u003d 66 which meets that requirement.\n\nThe idea is to rotate in icu70 once it\u0027s testing stable + reliable.  Then once we are fully converted over we can update these to \u003e\u003d 70. \n\nupdating these to \u003e\u003d 70 would break the build today before the bootstraps are done.",
