      "message": "So.. bootstrapping ICU 70 for every architecture will take a while and not be done all at once.\nWith that in mind, icu70-70.1 provides ICU \u003e\u003d 66 which meets that requirement.\n\nThe idea is to rotate in icu70 once it\u0027s testing stable + reliable.  Then once we are fully converted over we can update these to \u003e\u003d 70. \n\nupdating these to \u003e\u003d 70 would break the build today before the bootstraps are done.",

      "message": "Fine, but then, what exactly does this commit prepare for? If we merge this as-is and someone uploads an icu70 package on the bootstrap server, we will start building against icu70, but we will still declare a dependency on version 66 here.\n\nAs a result, during pkgman update, icu66 will be installed because haiku depends on it, and users will be allowed to uninstall icu70 and make their system unbootable.\n\nI think the right way to handle this is:\n\n- In BuildFeatures, define a variable: HAIKU_ICU_ABI_VERSION \u003d 66 (or 70 depending on package version)\n- Here, use that variable (replace 66 with %HAIKU_ICU_ABI_VERSION%)\n\nThis way, all that\u0027s left to od is enable the bootstrap package, and the next build will depend on the correct version.",
