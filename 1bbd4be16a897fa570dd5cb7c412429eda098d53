      "message": "nephele: Yes and no; as the comment says it was a quick fix to solve a legacy issue of closed pads not actually being deleted from the config and hence reappearing on the next launch (I\u0027m a bit surprised no one has noticed before). The background is that LaunchBox uses a peculiar pulse-based (SetPulseRate(3000000) in the app .cpp) way of detecting config changes, however closing of pads bypassed that since their local QuitRequested didn\u0027t report back to the parent. Actually, I don\u0027t quite understand why frequent pulsing would be the preferable to doing it the simple way like most other apps, but perhaps there was some reasoning behind it that I have yet to discover. Hence also why I opted for a quick fix for this commit rather than to mess with the underlying stuff.\n\nPulkoMandy: See above. As for too long lines, well, in this day and age with reasonably large screens (read: it\u0027s not the good ol\u0027 BeOS R5 HW days anymore), having mid-line line breaks for obscure (?) reasons could be equally considered bad coding practise. If this is part of the coding guidelines I propose this to be reconsidered.",
