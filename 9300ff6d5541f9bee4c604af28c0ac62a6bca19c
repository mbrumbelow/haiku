      "message": "Thank you for fixing the merge conflict. The code now looks correct matching the what\u0027s in master for this fix.\n\nThis fix avoids a number of Tracker crashes when right-clicking furiously.\n\nBeOS R5 behaved similarly to this change. BeOS closed the menu when right-clicking off the menu on a different Tracker window. This change closes the menu only if you right-click off the menu and on the same window that the menu belongs to (and then possibly crash).",
