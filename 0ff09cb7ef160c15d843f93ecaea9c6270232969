      "message": "lgtm.\nThe reason why I added this logic on the 32-bit arm is that we don\u0027t do identity mapping of all the bootloader areas - this is relevant only on 32-bit though, as they might be above 0x80000000 which can interfere with the kernel mappings. Not so much of an issue on 64-bit but probably it\u0027s better to have consistent behavior.",
