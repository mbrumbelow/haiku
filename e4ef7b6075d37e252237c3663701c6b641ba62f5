Shouldn\u0027t the TextView always get a chance to handle the key before it gets turned into a shortcut?\n\nI guess we already have this problem anyway for Cmd+A (select all) with TextViews in Tracker; it might be nice to find a more general solution...",

      "message": "I\u0027ve defined the MoveToTrash() as a shortcut on plain old B_DELETE with no modifiers so the default BWindow::KeyDown() method will detect that I\u0027ve created a shortcut and not try to send the key down to the view, instead calling MessageReceived() for me to handle. The alternative fix would be to do the fixup in the default BWindow::DispatchMessage() method to send B_DELETE to BTextView if it is the curent focus view even _if_ you\u0027ve defined the shortcut yourself.",

So it makes sense to register them with the window (so that it can decide which path to take). But maybe we should have a \"ShortcutPressed()\" method that each view can then implement.",
