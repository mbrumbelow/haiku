      "message": "riscv64 FPU switching code is functional, but it do not properly handle nested kernel iframes. So in theory it can corrupt kernel FPU state. Unlike Linux, Haiku allows to use FPU in kernel mode.\n\nIt if fine to apply change for now, but it need to be careful and implement complete correct kernel FPU state management in future.",

I have some experimental code for that but that\u0027s very much work-in-progress as of now. So I\u0027ll just submit this part for now.",
