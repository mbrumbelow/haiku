This is what https://github.com/haiku/haiku/tree/master/3rdparty/docker/cross-compiler was for.\n\u003e \n\u003e You can build the Haiku packages with `jam \u0027\u003crepository\u003eHaiku\u0027`, and then you can extract with the package tool, which will be easier to invoke with the rpath change.\n\u003e \n\u003e About the only issue I can foresee is with paths. I need an `ln -s /system /path/to/sysroot/boot/system`, having a way around that might be nice.\n\nFYI, this can probably be abandoned now, as a sysroot can be built without patching.\n\nCould possibly add https://github.com/jessicah/cross-compiler into the repo 3rd party scripts?",

      "message": "I\u0027m not a fan of doing everything with build profiles. Why not simply a different jam target instead? So you coud do \"jam -q sysroot\" and get it in generated/sysroot/ or something like that (or elsewhere if you set a specific path, but it should be possible to move it around easily anyway)?\n\nAt the very least, have an isSysroot variable generated from the argument-script (as documented above) rather than trying to guess from the other variables. What you did prevents from building a sysroot from inside Haiku, I don\u0027t see a reason for that.",
