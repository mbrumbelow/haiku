So you coud do \"jam -q sysroot\" and get it in generated/sysroot/ or something like that (or elsewhere if you set a specific path, but it should be possible to move it around easily anyway)?\n\nAt the very least, have an isSysroot variable generated from the argument-script (as documented above) rather than trying to guess from the other variables. What you did prevents from building a sysroot from inside Haiku, I don\u0027t see a reason for that.",
