(it is unlikely, as the functions would be completely broken if anyone tried to use them, but it is not impossible).\n\nMaybe we should set them explicitly to \"\u003d delete;\" and guard the whole thing with a #if __GNUC__ \u003e\u003d 4 to be sure to not break GCC2 builds and BeOS apps?",

      "message": "\u003e This actually removes the default implementation of the functions that would otherwise be generated by the compiler.\n\nThat is true.\n\n\u003e if they reference these functions\n\nThis sems to be impossible. Binaries cannot \"reference\" these functions because they do not exist in `libbe.so`. Instead, compilers try to generate implementations, which calls the corresponding functions in the base class, inside the consuming binary itself.\n\n\u003e as the functions would be completely broken if anyone tried to use them\n\nThe build then fails during link time, or, if dark magic is involved, the resulting library will fail to load during symbol resolution by `runtime_loader` because the corresponding base class functions are missing. Nobody will actually get to use those functions.",
